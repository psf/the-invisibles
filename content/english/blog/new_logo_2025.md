After a year of placeholder art and indecision, we finally have a real logo. And yes—it has a cat. On a mic. With a snake. We promise it makes sense.
Our original stand-in was a charming sticker from Mariatta’s [“#TypoOfTheDay”](https://mariatta.ca/posts/typo_of_the_day/) series. It wasn’t meant to be a logo, but we were so eager to get *Hidden Figures of Python* out into the world that we just rolled with it. MVP: Minimum Viable Purr.
Many drafts, discussions, and digital furballs later, our team chose the new design: a laid-back cat draped over a retro microphone, with a happy snake coiled in—our nod to the Python community that brought us all together.
We printed our first batch of stickers just in time for PyCon US this past May. They were glittery. They were gorgeous. They were gone in a flash. Sorry if you missed them—we had a tight budget and only printed a small run using our own pocket money. Blame the import tax on sparkles.
