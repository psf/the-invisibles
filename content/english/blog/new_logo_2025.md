## PyPodcats Have a New Logo
After a year of placeholder art and indecision, the PyPodcats team finally have a real logo. And yes‚Äîit has a cat. On a mic. With a snake. We promise it makes sense.

Our original stand-in was a charming sticker from Mariatta‚Äôs [‚Äú#TypoOfTheDay‚Äù](https://mariatta.ca/posts/typo_of_the_day/) series. It wasn‚Äôt meant to be a logo, but we were so eager to get *Hidden Figures of Python* out into the world that we just rolled with it. MVP: Minimum Viable Purr.

After the conclusion of our first season, we started discussing our plans and goals for this year, and among those ideas, one of them was to come up with a "real" logo for our group. Many drafts, discussions, and digital furballs later, our team chose the new design: a laid-back cat draped over a retro microphone, with a happy snake coiled in‚Äîour nod to the Python community that brought us all together.
We printed our first batch of stickers using this new logo just in time for PyCon US this past May. They were glittery. They were gorgeous. They were gone in a flash. Sorry if you missed them‚Äîwe had a tight budget and only printed a small run using our own pocket money. Blame the import tax on sparkles.
Another update about PyPodcats, in case you missed it, we are no longer eligible for funding from The Python Software Foundation, due to [the recent change](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/12/12psf-grants-program-charter-updates-part-3.html) in its grant structure. If you're curious of what it takes to run a podcast like ours, check our [financial info](/about/financials/) page.
