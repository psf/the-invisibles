We're happy to share that we received 2,000 USD in [grants](https://www.python.org/psf/grants/) from the [Python Software Foundation](https://python.org/psf-landing)!

> approved on December 13, 2023:
> 
> RESOLVED, that the Python Software Foundation Board grant $2,000 USD to PyPodcats: A Python Podcast series.

The fund from the Python Software Foundation will be used to cover operating costs in order to produce quality
and inclusive content, such as: audio transcription service, meeting scheduling software, domain name, video recording software,
and speaker recording equipments.

For transparency and accountability, we've created a public page with detailed information about [our finances]({{< ref "about/financials" >}}) and
how we're spending the grant. Read more about it [here]({{< ref "about/financials" >}}).

In addition to the grant, the Python Software Foundation also supports us by hosting [our episodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ujd1p6NuN4&list=PLFIcqSiijitiLEA3qxumx_ba2LNdd_sgs)
on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@thepsf). Our website's [source code](https://github.com/psf/the-invisibles) is also hosted on their [GitHub organization](https://github.com/psf).

The grant and support from Python Software Foundation enable us to produce quality and inclusive content so that we can
actively promote voices and stories from underrepresented group members in the global Python community.

Thank you, Python Software Foundation for your continued support!
