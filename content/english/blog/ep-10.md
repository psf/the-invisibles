Celebrate our 10th episode with us by listening to Una Galyeva's story!


 ```[text]
 I think I tried almost all. I was only mentioning that I didn't try PhD yet.
 Working for myself, working for someone else, starting my own company, growing my own company, selling my own company.
 ```

In this episode Una shares with us a bit about her self, her relocation to Amsterdam and her career journey. 

```[text]
I relocated to Amsterdam 11 years ago. So I think that was the love from the first sight.

I am talking about Amsterdam, not about a person.
```

Starting as a exectutive director in Netherlands and changing to freelancer, Una shares with us the benefits and challenges of becoming a freelancer in a new country and how to navigate those challenges. 
She later shares with us her recent experience in job search for high positions and salary negotions, and hiring cultural differences. 


Reviving PyLadies Amsterdam 7 years ago, Una shares with us why she thought there is a need for anotehr meetup and how to make PyLadies Amasterdam different and useful to the community by focusing on creating inclusive workshops and fostering a supportive environment for underrepresented groups in tech. She emphasizes hands-on learning, community building, and encouraging women to take leadership roles.


Listening to Una, seeing her adaptability, resiliance, her work as a community leader and how she maintains a clear vision for her career and community goals. I was fasciniated and really happy to be able to bring you all this episode.
