We're so excited about PyCon US 2024 in Pittsburgh. It was the first time the four
of the hosts were in the same room together to share news about our podcast
series to the Python community.

{{<twitter user="elthenerd" id="1791108857768370488">}}


At PyCon US, the PyPodcats team, Cheuk, Georgi, Mariatta, and Tereza,
gave a talk about the issues within our community with regard to diversity and inclusion,
specifically in the Python podcast community. We shared with our audience the idea
behind the podcast, the issue that we are addressing (not enough representation of
underrepresented folks, especially women, in Python podcasts) and how we make our production
process welcoming and inclusive.

## Audience response and advice

After our talk, we received a question from the audience who asked how they can go about
inviting women to their podcasts or events, because, in their experience the women usually
said no to their invitations.

Our advice is to show sincerity when inviting the women. Explain the reasoning of why you’d
like to invite them to the event, perhaps mention their accomplishments and their involvements
which would be relevant for the event. We also suggest asking for introductions from other
women in the network who know them more personally.  

Our talk was received very well. After our talk, many from the audience came to us to suggest
amazing women that they know of, and we are delighted to hear that! However, we are just one
podcast with limited production time. We have a long list of great guests waiting to be interviewed.

Therefore:

- We recommend that you suggest the names of the underrepresented group members who are doing
amazing work to other Python-related podcasts
- Invite them to speak at conferences and events that are happening in your community.
- If you are a podcast host and would like to learn how to be more welcoming to the guests from the
underrepresented group members, please watch the recording of our PyCon US talk as we have shared some
advice on how to treat the guests with respect and to gain their trust. 

### Inclusivity

Overall we find the PyCon US to be a welcoming and inclusive event, as can be seen from the following:

#### The Inaugural Outstanding PyLadies Award 


The [Outstanding PyLadies Award](https://pyladies.com/blog/Inaugural-Winners-of-the-Outstanding-PyLady-Award/outstanding-pylady-winners/)
was established to recognize the contributions and achievements from diverse group of Pythonistas.

We would like to extend our heartfelt congratulations to the first Outstanding PyLadies Award
recipients: [Abigail Mesrenyame Dogbe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abigail-mesrenyame-dogbe),
[Maaya Ishida](https://jp.linkedin.com/in/maaya-ishida-5486b7109), and 
[Jessica Greene](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica0greene).

#### Accessibility

Live captioning has been a feature at PyCon US conference for many years, and we are happy to see that PyCon US continued
to provide this by hiring the team from [White Coat Captioning](https://whitecoatcaptioning.com/).

PyCon US hired a personal guide for one of our podcast guest, [Jessica Tenger](https://pypodcats.live/speakers/jessica-tegner/),
who is fully blind. 

PyCon US hired ASL interpreters to provide sign language during the talks.

We appreciate the level of care and attention by PyCon US staff to ensure everyone is welcomed.

#### Diverse topic in the Open Spaces

We noticed very diverse topic in the open spaces showing that our community members are being welcomed and encouraged
to explore a variety of topic that interests them. For example, we saw that there was a Sushi-themed open space, open
space for Highschoolers, and an open space for another programming language, Rust.


#### Global community representation

We notice representation from worldwide Python communities. At the Expo Hall, there were [Community Booths](https://us.pycon.org/2024/expo/community-booths/)
from [PyCon APAC](https://pycon.asia/), [Black Python Devs](https://blackpythondevs.com/),
[PyLadies](https://pyladies.com/), and [Python en Español](https://hablemospython.dev/).
At the conference, there is a Spanish-language [Charlas](https://us.pycon.org/2024/speaking/charlas/) track.

We also personally met other Pythonistas from as far as Brasil, Namibia, Ghana, South Korea, and Japan.
We stumbled upon the Candy Exchange hosted by Python En Espanol community in the expo hall.

#### Our Talk about Podcast was accepted

We are grateful that the PyCon US Program Committee accepted our talk which is not at all very technical. It shows
to us that you don't have to only be a programmer or a developer in order to attend the conference. Python is not just
a programing language, but there is also a community surrounding it. By accepting our talk, it shows to us that the
Python community and the conference organizers do care about the health of the community and that everyone
is welcomed at the conference.

## Parting Thoughts

While overall the PyCon US is quite a positive and inclusive experience, we also want to recognize that this year at
PyCon US, the representation of women speaking at the conference is at 27%. This ratio is lower than it was 10 years ago,
where at PyCon US 2014 and 2015, [33% of the talks were by women](https://pypodcats.live/about/).
We hope that by highlighting this, the community as a whole can
think about, and work towards more equity and inclusion in this space in the future.

We are glad to receive positive feedback and compliments about our project and podcast series from the community members
at PyCon US. Your support is what drives us and the community forward. Please also look forward to our next episode.
