March 8th marks International Women's Day, a day dedicated to celebrating the achievements of women around the world and
advocating for gender equality. In the Python Podcast community,
[as we have previously reported](/blog/python_podcast_gender_diversity_and_representation/), women 
are underrepresented, and yet they continue to make meaningful contributions to the Python community.

Join us in recognizing them by celebrating and acknowledging their work and contributions.
Here are some of the ways you can do:
