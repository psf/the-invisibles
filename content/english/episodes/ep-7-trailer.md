Sneak Peek of our chat with Anna Makarudze, hosted by Mariatta Wijaya and Cheuk Ting Ho.

Since discovering Python and Django in 2015, Anna has been actively involved in the Django community. She helped
organize PyCon Zimbabwe, and she has coached at Django Girls in Harare and Windhoek.

She served on the Board of Directors at Django Software Foundation for five years, and she is currently a Django Girls
Foundation Trustee & Fundraising Coordinator.

Anna became aware of the lack of representation of women in tech industry, something that
became more evident as she attended Django Under the Hood in 2016 where most of the attendees were white men, and only
a few are women. That's when she realized the importance of communities like Django Girls in supporting more women in
the Django Community.

In this chat, Anna shared ways on how you can contribute and help support Django Girls+ Foundation.
