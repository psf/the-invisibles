The PyPodcats team, Cheuk, Georgi, Mariatta, and Tereza, got together and talked about their origin story.
We discussed the name: "Hidden Figures", what inspired us to start this podcast.

We shared our findings from analyzing data from popular Python podcasts, and wondered
about the diversity in the Python community.
