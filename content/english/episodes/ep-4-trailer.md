Jessica Tegner is an open source software developer and computer science student from Denmark who has been a part of 
the open source world for over 13 years. She is a maintainer of PyPandoc, a thin wrapper for the universal document
converter pandoc. Being fully blind has not stopped her from working as a software engineer intern at Uber,
being a member of the first GitHub Accelerator program or having the opportunity of being a world-conference public
speaker.
