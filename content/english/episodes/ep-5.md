We interviewed Mona Obedoza from The Philippines to hear about her inspiring journey.

Mona started learning to program when she was about five years old, first using block-based programming
language like Scratch, and she then advanced to text-based programming languages like Python, C#, and Java.

Even though she knows various programming languages, Python remains her favorite, not only for the programming
language itself, but because of the Python community. Her first public speaking engagement was in the Python
Philippines when she was 10 years old, and the support from the Python community has encouraged her to continue.
She has now spoken at many Python events and conferences, including at PyLadiesCon 2023.

Mona has been teaching other kids to code through workshops and hackathons. Being young
makes her in the best position to connect with other kids.

Mona created Project TEDDY, an AI powered-program
that helps school counsellors detects signs of distress in students, so that the counsellors could reach
out to the students in time and prevent mental health concerns from escalating.

Mona was encouraged by her mom since young to pursue tech and coding. Even though
she is still in highschool, she has big dreams and aspires to study abroad in the future.

Be sure to listen to the episode to learn all about Mona's inspiring story!
