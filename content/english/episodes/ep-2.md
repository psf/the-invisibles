We interviewed Karolina Ladino to hear about how she started learning Python, and becoming involved with the
Python community in Colombia.

Karolina has a background in robotics engineer and a master's degree in data analytics. She has been working
in the hardware industry and animatronics.

In this episode, Karolina shared some of the struggles and difficulties faced by women in Colombia, and how
she helped shaped the community, making it safer and more welcoming so that more women could have the opportunities
in the Python and tech communities.

We learned about Karolina's mentor, Professor Olmer, who not only supported and encouraged her studies but also served as an inspiration for her to pay it forward by extending her support to other women.

To those who are still learning Python or want to switch their career, Karo shared many useful advices, so be sure
to listen to the episode to learn from her!
