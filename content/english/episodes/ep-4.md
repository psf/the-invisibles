Jessica Tegner is an open source software developer and computer science student from Denmark who has been a part of 
the open source world for over 13 years. She is a maintainer of PyPandoc, a thin wrapper for the universal document
converter pandoc. Being fully blind has not stopped her from working as a software engineer intern at Uber,
being a member of the first GitHub Accelerator program or having the opportunity of being a world-conference public
speaker.

We interviewed Jessica Tegner from Denmark to hear about her journey in technology,
from modding Minecraft games into becoming an open
source maintainer.

Playing video games like Minecraft led her to learn programming and to solve problems with coding and technology.
She lost her vision in 2018, but it does not stop her from continuing to tinker with tools and technology. In
fact, it motivates her into creating and improving tools to be more accessible to the users.

Jessica is the maintainer of the popular PyPandoc library, which is a Python wrapper for the Pandoc library.
She was selected as the first cohort of the GitHub Accelerator program.

Jessica has spoken at several conferences but aspires to do more, and especially at Python conferences.
She wishes that events and conferences would have more accessibility information openly available.

Be sure to listen to the episode to learn all about Jessica's inspiring story!
