## Details of Each expenses

### Fastmail

Fastmail is our email address provider.

### internet.bs

We registered our domain name (pypodcats.live) through internet.bs.

### StreamYard

All of our episodes are recorded through StreamYard. (Professional subscription).

### VEED

All of our episodes are transcribed using veed.io. Each episode is first automatically transcribed, and then one of our team
members would review the result, and make manual edits. Transcript are uploaded to the YouTube video, and to our website.
Our podcast RSS feed include link to the transcripts using the <podcast:transcript /> tag. Transcription helps make
our content more accessible to the wider audience.

### Calendly

We use Calendly to manage appointment booking with our hosts and guest speakers. For each episode with our speaker,
we make two calendar appointments: a 30-minute preparatory call with the guest speaker and two hosts,
and a one-hour recording session. Using Calendly saves us time so that we can be more productive, instead of having to
write numerous back and forth emails to find a meeting time that works with all of us.

### Recording Equipments for Guest Speakers

We want to ensure our guest speaker feel confident and comfortable when they participate on our show. During the preparatory call,
we will be checking the quality of their mic and camera. When necessary, we will offer to cover the cost of
purchasing a better equipment. The majority of our funds are reserved for this purpose.

## Expenses that are not covered

Producing a podcast like ours is no small feat, and there are other costs involved that are not captured above.
Our team has decided not to spend the grant on the following items:

### Volunteer time

Each of our team members are lending their unique expertise and skill sets to produce the podcast series. They volunteer
their time, and energy, and will continue to do so.
Each of our speakers are also considered volunteers, and do not receive any remuneration for appearing on our podcast.

### Swag / promotional stickers

Our team members will be going to Python conferences around the world, to spread news about the podcast, and to share the accomplishments
of our invited podcast guests. We will be printing some stickers to share at conferences, however we will be paying for these out of pocket.

### Travel costs to conferences

We will not be withdrawing funds to cover the cost of our travel to conferences. Our team members will only attend conferences
when they're able to, using personal means, or in some cases, paid for by their employers.

## Why are we sharing this in public?

### Transparency and accountability

Our main source of funding comes from the Python Software Foundation, which receives funds through sponsorships, donations, and
memberships. By sharing this information, the wider Python community members will have a better visibility on how
the funds are being used and spent, and to understand the impact of your donations and sponsorship.

### Open Source, Open Knowledge

As an open source advocates ourselves, we believe in learning and sharing knowledge in public.
By documenting sharing our process and workflow, we hope that the wider community
can have a better understanding of the effort and care that we put into producing our podcast.
