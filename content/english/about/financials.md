## Details of Each expenses

### Fastmail

Fastmail is our email address provider.

### Domain Name

The annual subscription fee for pypodcats.live domain name.

### StreamYard

All of our episodes are recorded through StreamYard. (Basic subscription)

### VEED

All of our episodes are transcribed using veed.io. Each episode is first automatically transcribed, and then one of our team
members would review the result, and make manual edits. Transcript are uploaded to the YouTube video, and to our website.
Our podcast RSS feed include link to the transcripts using the <podcast:transcript /> tag. Transcription helps make
our content more accessible to the wider audience.

### Calendly

We use Calendly to manage appointment booking with our hosts and guest speakers. For each episode with our speaker,
we make two calendar appointments: a 30-minute preparatory call with the guest speaker and two hosts,
and a one-hour recording session. Using Calendly saves us time so that we can be more productive, instead of having to
write numerous back and forth emails to find a meeting time that works with all of us.

### Recording Equipments for Guest Speakers

We want to ensure our guest speaker feel confident and comfortable when they participate on our show. During the preparatory call,
we will be checking the quality of their mic and camera. When necessary, we will offer to cover the cost of
purchasing a better equipment. The majority of our funds are reserved for this purpose.

## Expenses that are not covered

Our team has decided not to spend the grant on the following items:

### Volunteer time

Each of our team members are volunteering to produce these podcast series, and will continue to do so.
Each of our speakers are also considered volunteers, and do not receive any remuneration for appearing on our podcast.

### Swag / promotional stickers

Our team members will be going to Python conferences around the world, to spread news about the podcast, and to share the accomplishments
of our invited podcast guests. We will be printing some stickers to share at conferences, however we will be paying for these out of pocket.

### Travel costs to conferences

We will not be withdrawing funds to cover the cost of our travel to conferences. Our team members will only attend conferences
when they're able to, using personal means, or paid for by their respective employers.
