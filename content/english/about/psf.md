The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and
to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers. The majority of the
PSF's work is focused on empowering and supporting people within the Python community. The PSF has active grant programs
that support sprints, conferences, meet ups, user groups, and Python development efforts all over the world. In addition,
the PSF underwrites and runs PyCon US, the primary Python community conference. Being part of the PSF means being part of the Python community.
