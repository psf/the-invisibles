Hidden Figures of Python podcast series is a hosted by the PyPodcats team: Cheuk Ting Ho, Georgi Ker, 
Mariatta Wijaya, and Tereza Iofciu. Our aim is to highlight
voices of the underrepresented group members of the Python community.

### Diversity in the Python community

There was a time where at PyCon US where only 1% of speakers were women.
With some intentionality, investment, and supportive community and outreach
efforts, this number improved, and by 2016, 40% of PyCon US speakers were women.

Thanks to efforts and investment by community members like Jessica McKellar,
the PyLadies community, and The PSF, that PyCon US speakers became more diverse
over time to reflect the diversity of the Python community.

### Representation in other areas

While we're seeing improvements in speaker diversity at Python conferences,
in other areas it still left much to be desired. Within the realm of popular
Python community podcasts, women make up less than 15% as podcast speaker guests.

We know that there are in fact many underrepresented members in our community
that are contributing to the Python community, and they deserve to be seen and
heard by the rest of us.

By creating this podcast series, we hope for the rest of the Python community
to learn more about the underrepresented community members and to appreciate
their contributions to the global Python community.

### About the name "Hidden Figures"

The name of the podcast was inspired by the book: "**Hidden Figures:
The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Who Helped Win the
Space Race**", by Margot Lee Shetterly. We find the stories and challenges depicted
in the book to be relatable to the Python community.


### About the name "Podcats"

[Podcats](https://mariatta.ca/posts/typo_of_the_day/podcats/) is one of Mariatta's [#TypoOfTheDay](https://mariatta.ca/posts/typo_of_the_day/).
The Podcats sticker was designed by [Mukta](https://www.fiverr.com/mbarts17),
commissioned by Mariatta.

While developing this website, Mariatta used the podcats sticker as a placeholder
image. However, the rest of the team really likes it too, so we all decided
to use the podcats as our logo and team name.
