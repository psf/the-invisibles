Sheena's early career saw her working as a software engineer and technical leader across multiple startups. But it was her passion for education that led her to devote the last 5+ years to re-imagining how we teach people to code professionally. 

Over the last half decade she has had the opportunity to work in the non-profit space and build alternative education systems from the ground up. Along the way she has learned a lot about how to teach well, how to build organisational systems that teach well, and why traditional education systems fall short. 

As a founder of Prelude.tech, she provides rigorous technical training, as well as consultating, and coaching for technical educators, and organisations with education functions (for example grad programs and similar).  Additionally, she leads the Guild of Educators, a community she founded to empower tech educators through shared resources, support, and evidence-based teaching practices.
