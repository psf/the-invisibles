00:00:21.573 --> 00:00:24.206
Hello Everyone

2
00:00:24.206 --> 00:00:25.172
It's great to

3
00:00:25.172 --> 00:00:28.498
have this episode because we have a very special guest.

4
00:00:28.498 --> 00:00:30.280
We have Karo here.

5
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.220
Do you want to say hi?

6
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.202
Hi, everyone. Thank you, Cheuk.

7
00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:36.898
Thank you, Mariatta, for the invitation.

8
00:00:36.898 --> 00:00:40.620
So this episode would be Mariatta and I would be here

9
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.356
to have a chat with Karo, to see her journey in

10
00:00:45.356 --> 00:00:50.108
Python and see what she's been doing and, yeah, hope that,

11
00:00:50.108 --> 00:00:53.604
you know, people can get inspired from her story.

12
00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:56.148
So, first of all, maybe I would

13
00:00:56.148 --> 00:00:58.372
like to ask Karo some question.

14
00:00:58.372 --> 00:01:02.276
Maybe before all these more deep dive questions,

15
00:01:02.276 --> 00:01:03.448
do you want to tell a little bit

16
00:01:03.448 --> 00:01:07.662
about yourself and about kind of why Python?

17
00:01:07.662 --> 00:01:09.090
Why you start Python?

18
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.100
Yeah, it's a really big question.

19
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.012
Usually, sometimes we forgot about what we have been

20
00:01:18.012 --> 00:01:21.682
doing in our life and how we can inspire

21
00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:24.652
other people, but usually that is not something that

22
00:01:24.652 --> 00:01:27.116
we are thinking all the time. Right.

23
00:01:27.116 --> 00:01:31.312
So I will try to put together what

24
00:01:31.312 --> 00:01:33.776
I was thinking to answer to that question.

25
00:01:33.776 --> 00:01:36.534
That is, like, why Python?

26
00:01:36.534 --> 00:01:41.168
I really don't know the, like, reason or root for that.

27
00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:44.470
I think it was like, a mix of reasons

28
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.708
that was happening in my life at that moment.

29
00:01:46.708 --> 00:01:48.388
And someone told me, like, yeah, you should

30
00:01:48.388 --> 00:01:51.188
try MicroPython, because I was struggling with some

31
00:01:51.188 --> 00:01:53.268
projects in that moment, and someone told me

32
00:01:53.268 --> 00:01:55.736
that, and I was maybe, yes.

33
00:01:55.736 --> 00:01:58.840
I started looking videos and reaching out more people

34
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.680
and another professor in the university that he was

35
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.398
trying to teach us more Python in our laboratories

36
00:02:06.398 --> 00:02:09.068
and exercise, and everyone was like, no, we want

37
00:02:09.068 --> 00:02:11.996
to stick with C, but that's it.

38
00:02:11.996 --> 00:02:15.202
Because we were working more with microprocessors

39
00:02:15.202 --> 00:02:17.320
in that moment, and everyone was like.

40
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.404
So is it related to your work, or is

41
00:02:21.404 --> 00:02:23.328
it something that you studied before?

42
00:02:23.328 --> 00:02:24.544
Maybe you can tell us a

43
00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:25.702
little bit about your background.

44
00:02:25.702 --> 00:02:26.940
Like, what do you do now?

45
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.732
Yeah, well, I have a background in robotics engineer, and

46
00:02:31.732 --> 00:02:35.170
I also have a master's degree in data analytics.

47
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.908
And I have been working in the

48
00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:44.186
hardware industry, creating machines, robot like installations

49
00:02:44.186 --> 00:02:46.580
animatronics and sort of things.

50
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.886
I'm more related with the art industry,

51
00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:52.712
like galleries and helping artists to create

52
00:02:52.712 --> 00:02:56.178
different installations and art pieces.

53
00:02:56.178 --> 00:03:02.092
And, like, about five years ago, I start to get

54
00:03:02.092 --> 00:03:05.800
more involved in the software industry, helping more people.

55
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.816
I started as a project manager, and

56
00:03:08.816 --> 00:03:11.542
then I become a product manager.

57
00:03:11.542 --> 00:03:13.568
So right now, I'm helping more.

58
00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:15.520
Like, I'm working more in product

59
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.490
creation, product design, product development.

60
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.510
Will you say you self-learn Python?

61
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.636
Yeah, I started myself and I got help.

62
00:03:27.636 --> 00:03:32.560
I really received many help from my professor, and then

63
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.340
he told me, there is something in the Internet, like,

64
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.878
looking for you to look for at that moment was plexi

65
00:03:40.878 --> 00:03:44.568
and look for other different places that are trying to

66
00:03:44.568 --> 00:03:49.234
teach in the journey, the easy journey in Python.

67
00:03:49.234 --> 00:03:54.370
And at some point I found a Slack, that was Python Colombia.

68
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.298
So I found the link to join Python

69
00:03:57.298 --> 00:04:00.576
Colombia and I was really welcoming and everyone

70
00:04:00.576 --> 00:04:02.854
was like, yeah, here are all the channels.

71
00:04:02.854 --> 00:04:07.264
Like a rain of channels, all the Slacks that we have.

72
00:04:07.264 --> 00:04:09.504
And it was like, you can introduce yourself here and

73
00:04:09.504 --> 00:04:12.068
you can ask your questions here and these are the

74
00:04:12.068 --> 00:04:14.922
list of topics that you can be talking about Python.

75
00:04:14.922 --> 00:04:19.940
So I then start understanding all the ecosystem behind Python and

76
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.880
it was a really open mind at that moment.

77
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.784
I was only expecting that the same that

78
00:04:27.784 --> 00:04:29.512
we expect in the academy, that you learn

79
00:04:29.512 --> 00:04:32.792
something specifically for do something and that's it.

80
00:04:32.792 --> 00:04:35.272
But no, Python is more than a

81
00:04:35.272 --> 00:04:39.452
tool that you can use into really

82
00:04:39.452 --> 00:04:42.802
multiple environments and industries and solutions.

83
00:04:42.802 --> 00:04:45.484
So yeah, that was the next step.

84
00:04:45.484 --> 00:04:48.350
So Python Colombia appears in the equation.

85
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.368
Yeah, very interesting how

86
00:04:50.368 --> 00:04:52.966
you discover Python Colombia.

87
00:04:52.966 --> 00:04:54.608
Is it like your professor told you about

88
00:04:54.608 --> 00:04:57.340
it or you just Google and found out?

89
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.212
I was googling and I found the web page and they

90
00:05:06.212 --> 00:05:09.946
were trying to put like, hey, this is the GitHub repository

91
00:05:09.946 --> 00:05:12.708
and this is the Slack and that is where we are.

92
00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:14.200
It wasn't like that moment.

93
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.136
They didn't have Telegram or the other

94
00:05:16.136 --> 00:05:18.312
or Discord as they have right now.

95
00:05:18.312 --> 00:05:19.864
It wasn't that big.

96
00:05:19.864 --> 00:05:22.360
But I realized that a couple

97
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.390
of friends were in that Slack.

98
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.312
I could get the invitation from them.

99
00:05:28.312 --> 00:05:30.620
So I started asking, hey, you are there.

100
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.508
And one of them told me, I

101
00:05:32.508 --> 00:05:34.156
don't know what you are talking about.

102
00:05:34.156 --> 00:05:35.580
And the other one was like,

103
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.596
yeah, I know, I really know.

104
00:05:37.596 --> 00:05:39.632
I understand the two phases, right?

105
00:05:39.632 --> 00:05:43.312
Many people in the communities are just join and

106
00:05:43.312 --> 00:05:45.870
they are there, but they are not part, but

107
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.278
there are others that are really really involved.

108
00:05:48.278 --> 00:05:52.116
So it could be neither of those, but

109
00:05:52.116 --> 00:05:55.332
they gave me the opportunity to join because

110
00:05:55.332 --> 00:05:57.818
it's by invitation in that Slack.

111
00:05:57.818 --> 00:06:01.636
So he gave me the invitation and at that moment,

112
00:06:01.636 --> 00:06:03.978
Is that by invitation to join

113
00:06:03.978 --> 00:06:06.050
the event or is it by invitation to join the

114
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.408
The Slack. I think they still have that.

115
00:06:12.408 --> 00:06:14.798
And now I'm part of the people that approve

116
00:06:14.798 --> 00:06:20.018
the invitations because the invitation is really funny.

117
00:06:20.018 --> 00:06:22.732
They provide your name or your email and they say

118
00:06:22.732 --> 00:06:25.388
like, hey, this is a friend or this is someone

119
00:06:25.388 --> 00:06:28.946
from this meetup or from someone from this university.

120
00:06:28.946 --> 00:06:31.638
And we understand that the people that is joining

121
00:06:31.638 --> 00:06:34.112
us are not bots and are not people that

122
00:06:34.112 --> 00:06:37.302
just want to post in, like a recruiter.

123
00:06:37.302 --> 00:06:38.854
That is not bad to have the recruiters

124
00:06:38.854 --> 00:06:41.492
in our environment, but we have rules to

125
00:06:41.492 --> 00:06:45.002
not getting spammed in our own Slack.

126
00:06:45.002 --> 00:06:48.670
So they have that filter.

127
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.660
But now folks know who to talk to now.

128
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.660
So that will be talk to you

129
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.806
definitely our viewer now have the advantage.

130
00:06:59.806 --> 00:07:01.262
They want to join PyCon Colombia,

131
00:07:01.262 --> 00:07:03.190
They will have to talk to you.

132
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.168
Yup.

133
00:07:04.168 --> 00:07:07.372
I think personally hearing what you said,

134
00:07:07.372 --> 00:07:11.612
it sounds like you learned by yourself.

135
00:07:11.612 --> 00:07:13.676
I mean, you learned about Python because

136
00:07:13.676 --> 00:07:16.668
of your own self motivation, even though

137
00:07:16.668 --> 00:07:18.096
you have lots of people to help.

138
00:07:18.096 --> 00:07:20.380
But it's inspiring to hear that

139
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.776
you took the steps yourself.

140
00:07:23.776 --> 00:07:26.864
You figure out who to talk to, you ask questions.

141
00:07:26.864 --> 00:07:29.760
So I think that's just how

142
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.732
the journey should be, right?

143
00:07:31.732 --> 00:07:35.120
So it's very inspiring for me.

144
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.098
Thank you, Mariatta.

145
00:07:37.098 --> 00:07:38.420
Thank you so much.

146
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.572
I just remember something else, too, that

147
00:07:41.572 --> 00:07:43.928
when I was finishing the bachelor of

148
00:07:43.928 --> 00:07:49.326
the engineering, a really marvelous professor appears.

149
00:07:49.326 --> 00:07:52.462
He was a new hire in the university,

150
00:07:52.462 --> 00:07:55.182
and he was really into Ros, the robotics

151
00:07:55.182 --> 00:07:59.210
operating system that you can use using Python.

152
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:01.436
And I was like, I want to do.

153
00:08:01.436 --> 00:08:03.948
It was a crazy idea that took me, like,

154
00:08:03.948 --> 00:08:06.200
one year and a half to build that.

155
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:11.008
I think how I got into that journey, I don't know,

156
00:08:11.008 --> 00:08:14.272
but I made it, and I'm really happy for that.

157
00:08:14.272 --> 00:08:20.810
I learned a lot of many stuff, like industrial designer,

158
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:25.220
how to build my own robots, how to program them.

159
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:30.084
It was a massive project, and all by myself

160
00:08:30.084 --> 00:08:33.840
and my professor, and he pushed me more.

161
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:38.621
I was afraid in that moment about the english barrier.

162
00:08:38.621 --> 00:08:41.496
I was having that worry in my life.

163
00:08:41.496 --> 00:08:43.342
I didn't have the confidence.

164
00:08:43.342 --> 00:08:46.712
I could read in that moment any papers, or

165
00:08:46.712 --> 00:08:48.860
I could do a tutorial or follow a video,

166
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.788
but I wasn't having the confidence to talk or

167
00:08:51.788 --> 00:08:53.452
to give a talk or something like that.

168
00:08:53.452 --> 00:08:58.892
And he was like, go ahead, I just send your

169
00:08:58.892 --> 00:09:01.564
talk to this conference, and now you have to go.

170
00:09:01.564 --> 00:09:04.144
And he was like, go ahead, you can do it.

171
00:09:04.144 --> 00:09:06.304
And I think he is like, a

172
00:09:06.304 --> 00:09:08.342
really big part of this journey.

173
00:09:08.342 --> 00:09:09.616
So I want to.

174
00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:13.764
Thanks to Olmer, my professor, Olmer. Yeah.

175
00:09:13.764 --> 00:09:16.720
And that is what I understand.

176
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:21.508
After, when we were working with PyLadies here in Colombia, we

177
00:09:21.508 --> 00:09:28.872
have maybe something different in the culture, like, we don't feel, as

178
00:09:28.872 --> 00:09:33.800
a woman, safe to go to a place at night.

179
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.408
It could be just like, for a group of study or

180
00:09:36.408 --> 00:09:39.770
for a meet up, like between six and nine PM

181
00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.932
It's not something that is easily for us

182
00:09:41.932 --> 00:09:44.870
to do for many reasons, like the insecurity,

183
00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:50.230
the transportation, you can find any excuse.

184
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:54.608
But we realized when we started in Bogota and in

185
00:09:54.608 --> 00:09:58.902
Medellin and in Cali, that if we made the meetup

186
00:09:58.902 --> 00:10:02.916
completely open for anyone that wants to join us, like

187
00:10:02.916 --> 00:10:06.692
the girls that were in university were bringing them, the

188
00:10:06.692 --> 00:10:11.732
father, the grandparent, could be their brother, anyone that can

189
00:10:11.732 --> 00:10:17.192
be with her joining the meetup and helping her to

190
00:10:17.192 --> 00:10:20.008
feel safe and then just to close the day and

191
00:10:20.008 --> 00:10:23.816
keep only the knowledge and enjoy the moment without thinking

192
00:10:23.816 --> 00:10:26.024
that something bad is going to happen after.

193
00:10:26.024 --> 00:10:31.058
So that was one of the reasons. We have spaces

194
00:10:31.058 --> 00:10:34.764
where we are only women in the space.

195
00:10:34.764 --> 00:10:37.298
But usually we do those in Saturdays

196
00:10:37.298 --> 00:10:39.008
and we involve also the children for

197
00:10:39.008 --> 00:10:41.290
those girls that are already mommies.

198
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.664
But during the weekday and at night,

199
00:10:47.664 --> 00:10:49.984
we usually make it open for everyone

200
00:10:49.984 --> 00:10:53.890
and we are receiving really nice people.

201
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:57.250
And that bringing in my mind, my professor,

202
00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:00.228
he was shooting at me behind like, hey

203
00:11:00.228 --> 00:11:02.116
Karo, you can do it and go.

204
00:11:02.116 --> 00:11:05.402
And we can go and ask the university for the expenses

205
00:11:05.402 --> 00:11:07.960
or maybe we can do like a raffle and find

206
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.190
money for your sponsorship and you can travel.

207
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:15.480
And that was something that changed my mind.

208
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.670
That was like a really big switch.

209
00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:19.480
Yeah.

210
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:24.268
I really like your story because I think it

211
00:11:24.268 --> 00:11:27.740
inspired not just women, but for allies that actually

212
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:32.854
having a good mentor is very useful, useful resources.

213
00:11:32.854 --> 00:11:38.400
So if any alllies they want to mentor again

214
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.380
resonate about what you said about PyLadies meetup that

215
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.522
it doesn't need to be a women-only environment,

216
00:11:46.522 --> 00:11:49.570
but it's like maybe women-driven environment.

217
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.268
If their allies want to be

218
00:11:51.268 --> 00:11:52.458
there to be supportive role.

219
00:11:52.458 --> 00:11:55.204
Like for example, if the participant bring another

220
00:11:55.204 --> 00:11:57.828
male family member to support them so they

221
00:11:57.828 --> 00:12:00.168
feel safe, then I think that is a

222
00:12:00.168 --> 00:12:03.780
very caring move that I really appreciate that.

223
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:09.048
And also I wonder because you said that,

224
00:12:09.048 --> 00:12:11.608
oh, your professor kind of encouraged you to

225
00:12:11.608 --> 00:12:14.508
do all you because I know you are

226
00:12:14.508 --> 00:12:19.230
helping to organize PyCon Colombia and also PyLadies.

227
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:20.704
How do you start doing that?

228
00:12:20.704 --> 00:12:24.502
Did you start PyLadies or how do you start becoming

229
00:12:24.502 --> 00:12:29.100
someone who kind of leading all these events and stuff?

230
00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:32.640
That was really interesting.

231
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.044
After I joined the community and I was still in

232
00:12:37.044 --> 00:12:44.442
the university, we were having IEEE group in the university.

233
00:12:44.442 --> 00:12:45.700
So I was leading that group.

234
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.728
So I learned a lot thanks to the university like

235
00:12:48.728 --> 00:12:52.328
to organize events and how to get the sponsorship and

236
00:12:52.328 --> 00:12:54.808
how to execute and invoices and all the work that

237
00:12:54.808 --> 00:12:58.120
you need to do behind to make an event happen.

238
00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:04.012
So when I hear and that was in the Slack that

239
00:13:04.012 --> 00:13:07.228
hey, we are starting PyLadies Medellin and we know that

240
00:13:07.228 --> 00:13:09.638
there is PyLadies Bogota, but we are not in Bogota.

241
00:13:09.638 --> 00:13:12.736
That was a couple of girls that were in

242
00:13:12.736 --> 00:13:19.142
Medellin, it was another Carolina and also Stephanie imagine.

243
00:13:19.142 --> 00:13:20.768
And I was like, hey, I would like

244
00:13:20.768 --> 00:13:23.734
to resume whatever that is here in Bogota.

245
00:13:23.734 --> 00:13:25.652
So I raised my hand and they

246
00:13:25.652 --> 00:13:27.044
were okay, let's do it together.

247
00:13:27.044 --> 00:13:31.476
And so we send the application to get

248
00:13:31.476 --> 00:13:35.672
again the access to the email and we

249
00:13:35.672 --> 00:13:39.512
start pinging different people to start getting back

250
00:13:39.512 --> 00:13:42.552
the accounts because that happens sometimes.

251
00:13:42.552 --> 00:13:44.888
Okay, who has access to this Twitter or

252
00:13:44.888 --> 00:13:48.170
who has the access to this account and

253
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.354
all the drives and all the files.

254
00:13:50.354 --> 00:13:52.012
So we start looking for that.

255
00:13:52.012 --> 00:13:56.124
And by the time different people start, okay, I

256
00:13:56.124 --> 00:13:57.756
have access to this, I can give you access.

257
00:13:57.756 --> 00:13:59.552
And we start organizing the house.

258
00:13:59.552 --> 00:14:02.566
And that was around 2018.

259
00:14:02.566 --> 00:14:05.648
So Medellin and Bogota start at the same time.

260
00:14:05.648 --> 00:14:10.780
And in that moment, Medellin was in that big moment.

261
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.786
That is like a label that we have here in Colombia.

262
00:14:15.786 --> 00:14:16.954
That is the Silicon Valley

263
00:14:16.954 --> 00:14:19.630
of Latin America, that is Medellin.

264
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.900
It's too big and many things are happening and all

265
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:28.318
the government are doing those efforts for getting more startups

266
00:14:28.318 --> 00:14:31.352
and that environment is safe for the nomads and for

267
00:14:31.352 --> 00:14:33.576
all the developers that want to come here.

268
00:14:33.576 --> 00:14:40.974
So Medellin started growing faster than Bogota, but Medellin

269
00:14:40.974 --> 00:14:44.908
got really those connections and with the sponsors, so

270
00:14:44.908 --> 00:14:47.794
those sponsors from Medellin start helping Bogota.

271
00:14:47.794 --> 00:14:51.312
So that was like a chain that was really nice.

272
00:14:51.312 --> 00:14:55.952
And those companies that were starting in Medellin, they start

273
00:14:55.952 --> 00:14:59.740
at some point reaching out the people and the ecosystem

274
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:04.358
in Bogota is kind of like the double of Medellin

275
00:15:04.358 --> 00:15:08.260
and move really big amount of money too.

276
00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.828
So it was like another

277
00:15:09.828 --> 00:15:11.700
different market for the companies.

278
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.670
So when they start arriving, like in 2019,

279
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:18.718
more companies start opening the offices in Bogota.

280
00:15:18.718 --> 00:15:23.278
So we start using the auditoriums and those rooms

281
00:15:23.278 --> 00:15:28.140
that they were allocating because they had in mind

282
00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:31.228
that it was like a really good movement for

283
00:15:31.228 --> 00:15:33.618
communities in Bogota as well than Medellin.

284
00:15:33.618 --> 00:15:37.292
So when they opened the offices, they were taking into

285
00:15:37.292 --> 00:15:39.968
account that, okay, we have to at least have a

286
00:15:39.968 --> 00:15:44.064
space for 30 people, 40 people, and they start saving

287
00:15:44.064 --> 00:15:47.862
those spaces for us and everything start growing.

288
00:15:47.862 --> 00:15:51.460
And now Medellin and Bogota, we are about the same

289
00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:55.508
amount of members and Cali is rising too.

290
00:15:55.508 --> 00:15:58.948
Cali started one year ago and now we are

291
00:15:58.948 --> 00:16:04.906
looking to encourage more girls across the different cities

292
00:16:04.906 --> 00:16:08.270
in our country to start other chapters.

293
00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:11.268
Yeah, that's great.

294
00:16:11.268 --> 00:16:16.010
But personally what keep you going because I mean,

295
00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:19.116
back in the time you could have say, okay,

296
00:16:19.116 --> 00:16:22.028
I wish someone do that, but why you put

297
00:16:22.028 --> 00:16:23.960
your hands up, say I would do it.

298
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:30.448
I think because I learned, I don't know when, but

299
00:16:30.448 --> 00:16:33.328
I learned that it's really nice how the

300
00:16:33.328 --> 00:16:36.090
life works to paying forward what you receive.

301
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.552
I receive a lot of love and

302
00:16:39.552 --> 00:16:41.840
work and help from different people.

303
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:44.986
Could be professors, could be someone from the university

304
00:16:44.986 --> 00:16:47.252
or could be just my family and friends.

305
00:16:47.252 --> 00:16:50.532
So I was thinking that I really

306
00:16:50.532 --> 00:16:54.094
got many privilege to be an engineer.

307
00:16:54.094 --> 00:16:57.700
I am the first engineer in my family, for example,

308
00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:01.976
I feel that I would like to make that other

309
00:17:01.976 --> 00:17:07.228
girls have those privileges, have those opportunities that at the

310
00:17:07.228 --> 00:17:12.650
end are not that privileged, are not that exclusive.

311
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.108
They are there.

312
00:17:14.108 --> 00:17:15.372
The opportunities are there.

313
00:17:15.372 --> 00:17:19.344
But we are afraid to take those challenges that at

314
00:17:19.344 --> 00:17:23.824
the very beginning could be really scary, but after that,

315
00:17:23.824 --> 00:17:25.690
you will see that you are not alone.

316
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:31.136
I want to give that to them.

317
00:17:31.136 --> 00:17:34.384
And that is kind of my voice all the time that

318
00:17:34.384 --> 00:17:37.508
I have in a meeting or a meetup or anything.

319
00:17:37.508 --> 00:17:38.788
It's like, hey, you can do it.

320
00:17:38.788 --> 00:17:40.356
Nothing bad is going to happen,

321
00:17:40.356 --> 00:17:41.684
so let's do it together.

322
00:17:41.684 --> 00:17:43.146
If you are afraid at the beginning,

323
00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:44.776
we can be here for you.

324
00:17:44.776 --> 00:17:47.918
And that is what we are trying to do with PyLadies

325
00:17:47.918 --> 00:17:52.050
and now we are like more than ten leaders.

326
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.288
And I am thinking that I would

327
00:17:55.288 --> 00:18:02.152
like to start taking some steps back.

328
00:18:02.152 --> 00:18:03.532
I'm just like, start

329
00:18:03.532 --> 00:18:05.516
Okay, let's document this.

330
00:18:05.516 --> 00:18:07.852
And now you are the leadership for this,

331
00:18:07.852 --> 00:18:09.404
and you are now the lead for this.

332
00:18:09.404 --> 00:18:13.904
And we start moving forward, giving them more power

333
00:18:13.904 --> 00:18:16.688
to feel that they are completely capable to do

334
00:18:16.688 --> 00:18:19.088
it, but to feel that they don't need me

335
00:18:19.088 --> 00:18:21.968
to be there all the time to accomplish the

336
00:18:21.968 --> 00:18:25.072
same things because they can't do it without me.

337
00:18:25.072 --> 00:18:28.660
And I don't know how many years I'm going to last,

338
00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.332
how much energy I'm going to have the following years.

339
00:18:31.332 --> 00:18:34.340
So, yeah, we need to transfer that knowledge, too.

340
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:39.880
That is pretty much like my motto, to transfer

341
00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.100
all the things that I receive to others.

342
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:47.976
I feel, again, really so inspiring to hear this

343
00:18:47.976 --> 00:18:54.092
story because you were initially yourself was supported and

344
00:18:54.092 --> 00:18:57.564
helped by your professor, and then now you yourself

345
00:18:57.564 --> 00:19:00.416
are able to even support even more women.

346
00:19:00.416 --> 00:19:04.256
And I think in the future, the women

347
00:19:04.256 --> 00:19:06.656
you support, they will further support more women.

348
00:19:06.656 --> 00:19:09.616
So it's just how to pay it forward.

349
00:19:09.616 --> 00:19:12.042
I really think it's really inspiring.

350
00:19:12.042 --> 00:19:13.920
And it works.

351
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.360
Yeah, it definitely works. Really.

352
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:23.908
The fact that we generate others just like giving

353
00:19:23.908 --> 00:19:26.772
the right words or just like saying hello or

354
00:19:26.772 --> 00:19:31.022
accepting or replying an email and forward and adding

355
00:19:31.022 --> 00:19:32.952
someone else that maybe I cannot help you, but

356
00:19:32.952 --> 00:19:34.820
this person maybe will help you.

357
00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:38.972
Those are the really minor actions that could change

358
00:19:38.972 --> 00:19:44.200
the lives of any person that reach out.

359
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.116
Yeah, I found it

360
00:19:47.116 --> 00:19:49.692
I resonate a lot about it because I also

361
00:19:49.692 --> 00:19:51.680
get involved in a lot of community work.

362
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.808
And I also feel that sometimes I

363
00:19:53.808 --> 00:19:55.520
got like, oh, it's a bit much.

364
00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.920
And I miss doing technical stuff.

365
00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.912
So I wonder how, because now my

366
00:20:00.912 --> 00:20:04.038
role is totally not involving coding.

367
00:20:04.038 --> 00:20:07.428
I'm like, mainly community work, but I do

368
00:20:07.428 --> 00:20:10.868
want to keep up, still want to do

369
00:20:10.868 --> 00:20:12.660
technical stuff maybe in the future.

370
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.324
So how could you think that?

371
00:20:16.324 --> 00:20:18.852
For example, for example, you're also now

372
00:20:18.852 --> 00:20:20.356
in a leadership role in your work.

373
00:20:20.356 --> 00:20:22.308
So how could you keep up with all

374
00:20:22.308 --> 00:20:25.108
this technical stuff that if you want to

375
00:20:25.108 --> 00:20:27.800
keep on doing, how would you manage?

376
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.322
When we are in a leadership

377
00:20:34.322 --> 00:20:37.510
position, we have more responsibility.

378
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.470
That is the truth.

379
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:46.288
And if I want my team and our product to be the

380
00:20:46.288 --> 00:20:51.872
best, we need to be using the coding applications or stack or

381
00:20:51.872 --> 00:20:54.484
find words or whatever that we want to call it.

382
00:20:54.484 --> 00:20:57.908
So we need to be up to date on

383
00:20:57.908 --> 00:21:01.284
what is happening and what the people is using

384
00:21:01.284 --> 00:21:06.408
and what the surveys are saying and what the

385
00:21:06.408 --> 00:21:09.512
organizations like the Python Software Foundation is saying.

386
00:21:09.512 --> 00:21:11.448
So we need to be there.

387
00:21:11.448 --> 00:21:14.008
And I think I really have a

388
00:21:14.008 --> 00:21:16.460
sure road to get that information.

389
00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.404
That is the community.

390
00:21:17.404 --> 00:21:21.260
So in the community there are always conversations like

391
00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:25.330
someone could post, do you know about this framework?

392
00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:26.780
Do you know about this?

393
00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:30.320
I found this repository in GitHub and is doing

394
00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.928
really interesting things and they have Notebooks or they

395
00:21:32.928 --> 00:21:36.774
have this, or they could be a really bold

396
00:21:36.774 --> 00:21:40.032
behavior that could start somewhere that we don't know

397
00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:42.228
exactly when, but is there.

398
00:21:42.228 --> 00:21:44.548
So that is kind of my way to keep

399
00:21:44.548 --> 00:21:47.396
the pace because everything is changing so fast too.

400
00:21:47.396 --> 00:21:52.052
So I try to keep the pace on Discord or

401
00:21:52.052 --> 00:21:54.936
in the chats, the different chats that the people

402
00:21:54.936 --> 00:22:00.968
are raising and even not always interacting, sometimes I only

403
00:22:00.968 --> 00:22:04.142
give a reaction and good, thank you for sharing.

404
00:22:04.142 --> 00:22:05.048
And that's it.

405
00:22:05.048 --> 00:22:07.708
But sometimes it's something that could be

406
00:22:07.708 --> 00:22:11.516
more involving my interest right now.

407
00:22:11.516 --> 00:22:14.428
So I could start discussion and making questions.

408
00:22:14.428 --> 00:22:22.704
So even if I don't use the stack or the new

409
00:22:22.704 --> 00:22:28.416
framework or application, I try to see the very first getting

410
00:22:28.416 --> 00:22:32.388
the stack to guys or a video or something that can

411
00:22:32.388 --> 00:22:36.404
explain to me how that works and maybe transfer that interest

412
00:22:36.404 --> 00:22:39.492
to my team or to my developers, or if it's something

413
00:22:39.492 --> 00:22:43.316
that I believe that is really big change.

414
00:22:43.316 --> 00:22:46.952
I take the time and I usually allocate a couple

415
00:22:46.952 --> 00:22:49.720
of hours in a week to study something new.

416
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.894
So I use those couple of hours like, okay, I'm

417
00:22:52.894 --> 00:22:55.032
going to sit and read here what is happening?

418
00:22:55.032 --> 00:22:58.428
And even if I try and everything is a mess, I try it.

419
00:22:58.428 --> 00:23:00.508
And maybe it's not that easy, or maybe I'm not

420
00:23:00.508 --> 00:23:06.626
reading well, but that keeps me in a technical perspective,

421
00:23:06.626 --> 00:23:11.290
even if I'm not using Python daily or coding daily.

422
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:14.496
I think that's a really good point.

423
00:23:14.496 --> 00:23:18.742
You showed that, actually, I know that some engineer

424
00:23:18.742 --> 00:23:21.180
will be like, oh, my manager doesn't know this.

425
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:24.368
I think you show a really good point of like, even

426
00:23:24.368 --> 00:23:27.428
if you're in a leadership position, you still have to keep

427
00:23:27.428 --> 00:23:29.188
up to date, you still have to know what's going on,

428
00:23:29.188 --> 00:23:32.130
even if you're not hands on doing it.

429
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.772
Of course we appreciate people who can do it hands on,

430
00:23:34.772 --> 00:23:38.296
but I think we also, on the other hand, appreciate people

431
00:23:38.296 --> 00:23:41.688
who kind of have a lot of responsibility but still kind

432
00:23:41.688 --> 00:23:45.548
of keep understanding the technology and up to date and be

433
00:23:45.548 --> 00:23:48.012
helpful to the rest of the team.

434
00:23:48.012 --> 00:23:48.412
Yeah.

435
00:23:48.412 --> 00:23:52.652
And I think also that we are not our

436
00:23:52.652 --> 00:23:56.236
work, we are human beings that needs time to

437
00:23:56.236 --> 00:24:01.856
understand a topic, provide a solution, reflect about any

438
00:24:01.856 --> 00:24:04.518
possible throws or solutions, and then execute.

439
00:24:04.518 --> 00:24:06.928
We are not executing all the 8 hours on

440
00:24:06.928 --> 00:24:11.630
a day, and that is like a false reality.

441
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:12.624
That is not true.

442
00:24:12.624 --> 00:24:15.488
So we need time to process information.

443
00:24:15.488 --> 00:24:19.300
And right now that we have tools, I know we have

444
00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.972
AI, we have chats, we have many things that could help

445
00:24:21.972 --> 00:24:25.992
us to process information quickly, but we need to make sure

446
00:24:25.992 --> 00:24:29.272
that we are processing that information in our mind, like I

447
00:24:29.272 --> 00:24:31.810
really understand it, or I'm just copy and paste.

448
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:36.088
I think that is something that we are

449
00:24:36.088 --> 00:24:38.828
missing because we want, and the company and

450
00:24:38.828 --> 00:24:42.578
the product and the market want quicker results.

451
00:24:42.578 --> 00:24:44.636
And that is something that is

452
00:24:44.636 --> 00:24:46.396
pushing really hard on us.

453
00:24:46.396 --> 00:24:49.132
And it could be anyone in our community or in other

454
00:24:49.132 --> 00:24:53.968
communities, like development communities is really hard that we need to

455
00:24:53.968 --> 00:24:56.784
make a whole dashboard in one day, or we need to

456
00:24:56.784 --> 00:24:59.888
implement this dashboard in one day, or we need to do,

457
00:24:59.888 --> 00:25:01.796
I don't know how many reports in one day.

458
00:25:01.796 --> 00:25:05.300
And it's okay, take it easy.

459
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:07.412
Sometimes we can make it in one day,

460
00:25:07.412 --> 00:25:10.388
but after a couple of days of research

461
00:25:10.388 --> 00:25:13.640
or investigation, and the result will be better.

462
00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.312
So that is like a call for

463
00:25:16.312 --> 00:25:19.918
everyone that could hear this podcast.

464
00:25:19.918 --> 00:25:22.728
Take the time to think and plan your

465
00:25:22.728 --> 00:25:26.044
solutions and investigate and research, of course.

466
00:25:26.044 --> 00:25:31.628
So regarding that, you make a very good

467
00:25:31.628 --> 00:25:33.560
point for people who are already working.

468
00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:36.588
Let's say they're working in a technical team, of

469
00:25:36.588 --> 00:25:38.748
course, for something that's new for them, they can

470
00:25:38.748 --> 00:25:40.172
take time to research, like you said.

471
00:25:40.172 --> 00:25:42.112
But what if someone want to

472
00:25:42.112 --> 00:25:44.390
start, someone want to learn coding?

473
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:47.398
That they may not be working as an engineer

474
00:25:47.398 --> 00:25:49.760
or working in a technical team at the moment,

475
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.700
but they may want to do a career change.

476
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:56.298
Or maybe they are like we were, we were studying

477
00:25:56.298 --> 00:25:58.922
something and then we, oh, we want to start coding.

478
00:25:58.922 --> 00:26:02.692
And so how would you suggest, do people still

479
00:26:02.692 --> 00:26:04.420
have to spend a lot of time on research,

480
00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.262
or people who, let's say, go to a PyLadies

481
00:26:07.262 --> 00:26:08.952
and join a workshop, something like that.

482
00:26:08.952 --> 00:26:12.600
So what would you recommend?

483
00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.856
For each person, sorry, it will be a different way.

484
00:26:14.856 --> 00:26:19.032
So I would like to recommend to find the way

485
00:26:19.032 --> 00:26:22.898
that you like to learn and put all the variables.

486
00:26:22.898 --> 00:26:25.596
Okay, I want to do this in a limit of two months.

487
00:26:25.596 --> 00:26:28.204
I want to change my career and I only have one quarter to

488
00:26:28.204 --> 00:26:31.980
do it, or I have six months at least to do it.

489
00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.670
So what is my time frame?

490
00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:35.376
So if I want to do it in a

491
00:26:35.376 --> 00:26:38.592
more intense way or if I have the time.

492
00:26:38.592 --> 00:26:40.038
So I'm going to go to a meetup

493
00:26:40.038 --> 00:26:43.222
and just see if I feel the vibe.

494
00:26:43.222 --> 00:26:46.720
So we have in the community made

495
00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.788
plenty of things that you can do.

496
00:26:48.788 --> 00:26:50.948
So you can join us in the future of meetup, or you

497
00:26:50.948 --> 00:26:53.896
can follow us and review the videos that we already post.

498
00:26:53.896 --> 00:26:57.064
We have a good amount of.

499
00:26:57.064 --> 00:27:00.808
Really dummy, Welcome to Python videos that you

500
00:27:00.808 --> 00:27:05.208
can just rewatch and see if you think.

501
00:27:05.208 --> 00:27:07.452
And we have workshops, of course.

502
00:27:07.452 --> 00:27:15.810
So sometimes we do really starting beginners

503
00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:20.018
workshop for different industries or fields.

504
00:27:20.018 --> 00:27:21.952
So what else?

505
00:27:21.952 --> 00:27:24.912
I also can recommend that if you want to start

506
00:27:24.912 --> 00:27:26.608
and you are completely sure that you want to start

507
00:27:26.608 --> 00:27:30.900
with Python, that usually is the easy way to start.

508
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:35.092
Like, the learning curve for coding with Python is

509
00:27:35.092 --> 00:27:38.868
really nice, it's friendly, and there are a lot

510
00:27:38.868 --> 00:27:43.224
of people open to explain to you, or if you

511
00:27:43.224 --> 00:27:45.128
don't want to speak with someone.

512
00:27:45.128 --> 00:27:47.410
You can also find more resources.

513
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.656
There are millions of resources online,

514
00:27:51.656 --> 00:27:53.750
even you don't need to pay.

515
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.896
Many of them are completely free.

516
00:27:55.896 --> 00:27:58.204
So you can switch between and you

517
00:27:58.204 --> 00:28:01.458
can choose, but don't keep switching forever.

518
00:28:01.458 --> 00:28:03.970
That is another advice.

519
00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:05.714
So you can choose one if you don't

520
00:28:05.714 --> 00:28:07.612
like it, okay, switch to another one.

521
00:28:07.612 --> 00:28:10.124
But something else is happening.

522
00:28:10.124 --> 00:28:11.808
Try to find the reason, the root of

523
00:28:11.808 --> 00:28:14.678
the cause that you don't understand a topic.

524
00:28:14.678 --> 00:28:16.112
And maybe the next step is

525
00:28:16.112 --> 00:28:17.846
not switching to another resource.

526
00:28:17.846 --> 00:28:19.734
Maybe looking for a mentor.

527
00:28:19.734 --> 00:28:22.832
And in the communities we have really big amount of

528
00:28:22.832 --> 00:28:26.022
people that is open and we have labels and roles

529
00:28:26.022 --> 00:28:28.778
in this core, that is people, that is mentor.

530
00:28:28.778 --> 00:28:31.572
And you can filter by mentor and you can just ping them

531
00:28:31.572 --> 00:28:35.844
and hey, I'm trying to do this and I'm not able to.

532
00:28:35.844 --> 00:28:38.554
And I know people that has slots

533
00:28:38.554 --> 00:28:41.080
of times, they have a calendar available,

534
00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.300
could be just 15 minutes, 30 minutes.

535
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:48.012
I have my own, for example, where I can help people.

536
00:28:48.012 --> 00:28:52.092
Could be any topic, IoT, art, or

537
00:28:52.092 --> 00:28:54.972
finding a learning curve, a learning path. Sorry.

538
00:28:54.972 --> 00:28:58.828
So could be any question that you may have.

539
00:28:58.828 --> 00:29:00.864
I know that will be a person

540
00:29:00.864 --> 00:29:02.736
that will be open to answer.

541
00:29:02.736 --> 00:29:07.150
So first of all, join the community.

542
00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:08.864
We are really nice people.

543
00:29:08.864 --> 00:29:11.574
We are going to be open to help you anytime.

544
00:29:11.574 --> 00:29:13.402
And then you can follow your own path.

545
00:29:13.402 --> 00:29:15.002
You will be defining your own path.

546
00:29:15.002 --> 00:29:17.508
So you will follow your instance, and you

547
00:29:17.508 --> 00:29:22.870
will see that it's really nice, it's satisfactory.

548
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:25.672
When you found that you were trying

549
00:29:25.672 --> 00:29:27.800
to understand this, and finally you understand

550
00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.940
this, but plenty amount of things.

551
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:36.584
Go ahead. Yeah.

552
00:29:36.584 --> 00:29:38.898
I mentioned a workshop because Karo helped

553
00:29:38.898 --> 00:29:42.108
us to organize some Humble Data workshop, so,

554
00:29:42.108 --> 00:29:45.690
yeah, she's very experienced in doing that.

555
00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:46.440
Yeah.

556
00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:49.906
I just want to say, feel really related

557
00:29:49.906 --> 00:29:52.048
to that, because it is also through the

558
00:29:52.048 --> 00:29:54.192
Python community that I learned a lot.

559
00:29:54.192 --> 00:29:55.040
Like, I learned about.

560
00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.752
I even learned about how to

561
00:29:56.752 --> 00:29:59.312
contribute to open source and speaking.

562
00:29:59.312 --> 00:30:03.540
I got mentors as well, and I feel that's the difference

563
00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:08.004
of the Python community, the fact that there is a community

564
00:30:08.004 --> 00:30:12.788
that is willing and wanting to help you, and all you

565
00:30:12.788 --> 00:30:17.120
need to do is just learn and then pay it forward. Right.

566
00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:21.440
It's awesome to hear that.

567
00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:23.108
Yeah.

568
00:30:23.108 --> 00:30:24.708
I could say that there are no

569
00:30:24.708 --> 00:30:29.164
more welcoming community than the Python community.

570
00:30:29.164 --> 00:30:30.310
It's incredible.

571
00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:34.124
Anywhere is really like, you

572
00:30:34.124 --> 00:30:35.420
are in the Python community. Nice.

573
00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.796
Where you know these people

574
00:30:36.796 --> 00:30:40.416
and everyone knows each other.

575
00:30:40.416 --> 00:30:46.118
So it's wonderful when you go in that circle.

576
00:30:46.118 --> 00:30:47.046
It's incredible.

577
00:30:47.046 --> 00:30:48.970
It's really nice and inspiring.

578
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:50.880
Yeah.

579
00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.808
I think that joining the community is a very

580
00:30:53.808 --> 00:30:56.602
good way, because if you do it yourself, it's

581
00:30:56.602 --> 00:30:58.516
very high chance you would give up.

582
00:30:58.516 --> 00:31:00.228
But if you do it with the community,

583
00:31:00.228 --> 00:31:03.070
you kind of feel like you're not alone.

584
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:06.344
You won't procrastinate so much, and

585
00:31:06.344 --> 00:31:09.208
you're more motivated to do something.

586
00:31:09.208 --> 00:31:11.742
So that's why when I was learning Rust,

587
00:31:11.742 --> 00:31:14.984
I also start to maybe film myself.

588
00:31:14.984 --> 00:31:21.170
So I kind of want to get more support from my viewers.

589
00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:25.080
So that feel better than doing it yourself.

590
00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:31.296
But how could someone, let's say, especially women, who maybe

591
00:31:31.296 --> 00:31:36.352
feel that, oh, tech is very not something they would

592
00:31:36.352 --> 00:31:38.592
aspire to do when they were a girl?

593
00:31:38.592 --> 00:31:40.868
Because in my culture, when you grow up, if

594
00:31:40.868 --> 00:31:43.338
you're a girl, then you probably won't get encouraged

595
00:31:43.338 --> 00:31:49.310
to do engineering or science or coding.

596
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:53.172
So I think especially for women and

597
00:31:53.172 --> 00:31:55.400
community, supportive network is very important.

598
00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.760
But how can they find out?

599
00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.598
Because you were lucky to have a professor that's

600
00:32:01.598 --> 00:32:03.784
very supportive, and then you found PyCon Colombia, and

601
00:32:03.784 --> 00:32:06.306
find a friend who get you into the Slack.

602
00:32:06.306 --> 00:32:07.212
But how?

603
00:32:07.212 --> 00:32:08.652
Except that they have to find

604
00:32:08.652 --> 00:32:09.990
you to get into the Slack.

605
00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:14.840
How can someone find a way?

606
00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:22.688
I think, and we believe a lot here in

607
00:32:22.688 --> 00:32:25.328
Colombia, that the voice to voice is, like,

608
00:32:25.328 --> 00:32:28.224
the best way to make something happen.

609
00:32:28.224 --> 00:32:32.612
So we try to tell that to anyone that join us.

610
00:32:32.612 --> 00:32:38.394
Even if you are just hearing that, even your own daughter

611
00:32:38.394 --> 00:32:42.728
or your niece or someone that you hear that would like

612
00:32:42.728 --> 00:32:46.376
to start coding, just send them the web page.

613
00:32:46.376 --> 00:32:47.448
We have a web page.

614
00:32:47.448 --> 00:32:50.168
So PyLadies Co. pyladies dot co

615
00:32:50.168 --> 00:32:55.976
So you can just find the chapter that is closer to you

616
00:32:55.976 --> 00:32:59.500
or the meetup that you would like to see or to watch.

617
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:03.794
Because we are always streaming our events.

618
00:33:03.794 --> 00:33:07.458
After the pandemic, our mind changed and we realized

619
00:33:07.458 --> 00:33:10.650
that many of our people just left the country

620
00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:13.216
and we want to keep there for them.

621
00:33:13.216 --> 00:33:16.118
So that is why we keep streaming all the events.

622
00:33:16.118 --> 00:33:18.912
And for new people that is coming after or

623
00:33:18.912 --> 00:33:22.224
for people that is from other places of the

624
00:33:22.224 --> 00:33:24.240
world, they can be part of us.

625
00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:28.916
And the way that they can look for us,

626
00:33:28.916 --> 00:33:31.530
we are pretty much in all the social medias.

627
00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:34.734
I think we are in Instagram, TikTok, like everywhere.

628
00:33:34.734 --> 00:33:39.992
If they search by Python or we are trying

629
00:33:39.992 --> 00:33:42.328
to do our homework well, that is putting all

630
00:33:42.328 --> 00:33:45.774
the hashtags and tagging all the different communities.

631
00:33:45.774 --> 00:33:48.180
We are trying to be there for all of them.

632
00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:51.708
I hope if they don't find us in the

633
00:33:51.708 --> 00:33:54.908
very first search, someone can let us know that

634
00:33:54.908 --> 00:33:56.812
we exist and we are here for them.

635
00:33:56.812 --> 00:34:01.168
And they only need to click on a follow or they

636
00:34:01.168 --> 00:34:06.272
can only click and join us in our Discord server where

637
00:34:06.272 --> 00:34:09.179
we are talking about different topics all the time.

638
00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:13.812
We are here for them.

639
00:34:13.812 --> 00:34:17.790
I hope they can find us easily.

640
00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:21.476
We have been asking us that, Cheuk, really

641
00:34:21.476 --> 00:34:24.020
long time ago how we can reach them.

642
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:28.260
We try to reach out also

643
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:31.678
school professors for different parents.

644
00:34:31.678 --> 00:34:33.768
Like, my mom helped me a lot when I was

645
00:34:33.768 --> 00:34:38.027
a kid also, she was like, you can explore and

646
00:34:38.027 --> 00:34:39.676
you can play with anything that you want.

647
00:34:39.676 --> 00:34:41.851
And I really appreciate that she did that

648
00:34:41.851 --> 00:34:46.188
because I was really into robotics since my

649
00:34:46.188 --> 00:34:48.411
twelve years old, something like that.

650
00:34:48.411 --> 00:34:49.938
She was like, okay, you want a robot?

651
00:34:49.938 --> 00:34:51.746
Okay, let's go and find a robot.

652
00:34:51.746 --> 00:34:53.888
I didn't want a Barbie. After I want a

653
00:34:53.888 --> 00:34:55.942
Barbie, but then it was like a robot.

654
00:34:55.942 --> 00:34:58.118
And she was like, okay, let's go with the robot.

655
00:34:58.118 --> 00:35:01.490
And then was like a party of robots and Barbies.

656
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:02.510
Who knows?

657
00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:06.682
That is really funny.

658
00:35:06.682 --> 00:35:09.028
And she was like, okay, let's do it.

659
00:35:09.028 --> 00:35:12.698
When we receive parents in our meetups, we try to encourage

660
00:35:12.698 --> 00:35:17.192
them to do the same because the girls, the women are

661
00:35:17.192 --> 00:35:20.020
like, we are feeling lost in the process of finding

662
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:25.464
I want to feel that I have something that identify myself

663
00:35:25.464 --> 00:35:29.788
and I'm good at that and I'm getting that inspiration to

664
00:35:29.788 --> 00:35:32.316
wake up and get up from the bed and say, okay,

665
00:35:32.316 --> 00:35:34.188
this is what I want to do today.

666
00:35:34.188 --> 00:35:36.412
And we are struggling and that

667
00:35:36.412 --> 00:35:38.108
is like from decades ago.

668
00:35:38.108 --> 00:35:40.352
We are struggling a lot to find that.

669
00:35:40.352 --> 00:35:43.820
And since the industry is moving that fast?

670
00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:46.886
I don't know how fast we are moving as generations

671
00:35:46.886 --> 00:35:50.358
and as parents, teaching them that they have a sea

672
00:35:50.358 --> 00:35:53.684
of possibilities and they can do whatever that they want.

673
00:35:53.684 --> 00:35:57.012
I think the academy, the industry, the

674
00:35:57.012 --> 00:36:00.640
schools, we need to find connecting us.

675
00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:02.720
I don't know.

676
00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:04.964
You can be at the school, you can be at the

677
00:36:04.964 --> 00:36:07.592
university, but you can be also part of the community.

678
00:36:07.592 --> 00:36:09.928
So PyLadies is not something that

679
00:36:09.928 --> 00:36:11.230
you need to be exclusive.

680
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:12.984
And that's something that you

681
00:36:12.984 --> 00:36:15.342
could be just there liking,

682
00:36:15.342 --> 00:36:18.302
following us, sharing, assisting to the meetups,

683
00:36:18.302 --> 00:36:20.924
attending to the meetups, and that's it.

684
00:36:20.924 --> 00:36:22.332
That is what we need from you.

685
00:36:22.332 --> 00:36:26.946
And that is what is changing the scene.

686
00:36:26.946 --> 00:36:28.120
But I don't know.

687
00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:31.122
That is an open question, Cheuk

688
00:36:31.122 --> 00:36:32.920
I think.

689
00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.406
I think go back to the point that we need allies.

690
00:36:36.406 --> 00:36:41.152
I think we need people who tell whoever they know that,

691
00:36:41.152 --> 00:36:44.700
oh, they may want to learn this, or they are like,

692
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:47.348
you may have a friend who come to you and say

693
00:36:47.348 --> 00:36:49.636
that, oh, I might be struggling with what I'm doing.

694
00:36:49.636 --> 00:36:51.332
I don't like what I'm doing right now.

695
00:36:51.332 --> 00:36:52.996
I want to try something new.

696
00:36:52.996 --> 00:36:55.368
And you think that they will be great coding then

697
00:36:55.368 --> 00:36:59.672
just like, hey, come to this PyLady and do.

698
00:36:59.672 --> 00:37:02.328
I do sometimes have people who say,

699
00:37:02.328 --> 00:37:05.838
oh, they want to invite, maybe introduce

700
00:37:05.838 --> 00:37:10.890
their spouse to coding or coworker.

701
00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.212
I know that, for example, Karo, you

702
00:37:13.212 --> 00:37:15.436
bring some of your coworker into help

703
00:37:15.436 --> 00:37:18.120
organizing things in the community as well

704
00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:23.680
So it's good to have a presence

705
00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.632
online so people can easily find you.

706
00:37:25.632 --> 00:37:28.838
But at the same time, I think there's

707
00:37:28.838 --> 00:37:30.502
so many things out there in the Internet

708
00:37:30.502 --> 00:37:32.772
still, like reference and word of mouth is

709
00:37:32.772 --> 00:37:36.450
maybe the traditional way to bring people in.

710
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:38.756
There is a challenge, but if someone hear

711
00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:41.268
us and knows another way to reach out

712
00:37:41.268 --> 00:37:43.280
to people, please just let us know.

713
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:46.350
We need ideas.

714
00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:49.384
We are open to execute new ideas and we

715
00:37:49.384 --> 00:37:52.872
are here to make everything you need aside to

716
00:37:52.872 --> 00:37:54.632
make that happen, to make that happen.

717
00:37:54.632 --> 00:37:59.692
So we are really in a willing way

718
00:37:59.692 --> 00:38:02.780
or status or mood to help everyone.

719
00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:07.532
And I really hope, I wish at some point,

720
00:38:07.532 --> 00:38:11.650
we are always having a chart of increasing.

721
00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:15.632
After each meetup, we have between 50 or 60

722
00:38:15.632 --> 00:38:18.886
new people followers, and we have always those peaks.

723
00:38:18.886 --> 00:38:21.658
But I would like to see one day, one huge peak

724
00:38:21.658 --> 00:38:25.520
to understand what else we can do, what we did.

725
00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:29.770
And even if we are following all these structures

726
00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:32.856
that Instagram gives you, or TikTok gives you, like

727
00:38:32.856 --> 00:38:36.312
post one story one day and two stories per

728
00:38:36.312 --> 00:38:37.912
day or two posts per day.

729
00:38:37.912 --> 00:38:39.592
And even if you follow all of

730
00:38:39.592 --> 00:38:42.930
those, we are not yet influencers.

731
00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:49.042
We are still not in the eyes of the algorithm.

732
00:38:49.042 --> 00:38:52.706
So we are still not viral.

733
00:38:52.706 --> 00:38:55.612
And I wish we could be viral like many

734
00:38:55.612 --> 00:38:59.340
people following us and getting our content, that we

735
00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:02.608
really take the time, the time to build, to

736
00:39:02.608 --> 00:39:05.312
prepare and to post the content.

737
00:39:05.312 --> 00:39:08.230
For example, you both are doing with these podcasts.

738
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:10.640
That is a really big effort that

739
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.644
many people do in the community.

740
00:39:12.644 --> 00:39:17.722
And I know that we are reaching our people, at our audience,

741
00:39:17.722 --> 00:39:20.628
but I wish we can reach out more people, each time.

742
00:39:20.628 --> 00:39:26.356
But I don't know, maybe the algorithm is thinking

743
00:39:26.356 --> 00:39:28.856
different, and we are not selling something here.

744
00:39:28.856 --> 00:39:30.610
So it's weird.

745
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:33.406
It's a challenge.

746
00:39:33.406 --> 00:39:35.730
Yeah, that's really a challenge.

747
00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:39.292
I think we are almost at the end.

748
00:39:39.292 --> 00:39:42.092
So do you have one last thing or anything you want to

749
00:39:42.092 --> 00:39:44.668
tell the viewers or just spread the word to the world?

750
00:39:44.668 --> 00:39:50.304
Anything, you have to say it then now is the chance.

751
00:39:50.304 --> 00:39:50.768
I think.

752
00:39:50.768 --> 00:39:53.968
I would like to add that you don't need to be

753
00:39:53.968 --> 00:39:58.190
coding all days to be part of the Python community.

754
00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:02.928
You can use Python once in a

755
00:40:02.928 --> 00:40:05.076
semester or once in a month.

756
00:40:05.076 --> 00:40:06.900
But you know Python and you

757
00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.092
understand Python and you are like.

758
00:40:09.092 --> 00:40:10.884
Or you want to understand Python and

759
00:40:10.884 --> 00:40:12.228
you want to use it more.

760
00:40:12.228 --> 00:40:15.598
It could be any reason related to Python,

761
00:40:15.598 --> 00:40:20.862
or maybe related to another language, programming language,

762
00:40:20.862 --> 00:40:23.848
or another things that you saw that maybe

763
00:40:23.848 --> 00:40:25.198
someone else did with Python.

764
00:40:25.198 --> 00:40:26.428
That was easy.

765
00:40:26.428 --> 00:40:28.668
So you are more than welcome.

766
00:40:28.668 --> 00:40:31.628
So I want to open the invitation and

767
00:40:31.628 --> 00:40:35.610
to join really your local community for Python.

768
00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:40.672
I could say, without any afraid to be wrong.

769
00:40:40.672 --> 00:40:43.360
I could say that mostly all the countries have

770
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:47.856
at least one charter of PyLadies or Python, or

771
00:40:47.856 --> 00:40:49.990
it could be in your own continent.

772
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:53.286
So even if you don't have it in your local town,

773
00:40:53.286 --> 00:40:55.668
you can open it and you will find people that will

774
00:40:55.668 --> 00:40:58.788
be interesting with you to chat once in a month, one

775
00:40:58.788 --> 00:41:01.988
in a week, and you will receive the support for all

776
00:41:01.988 --> 00:41:05.176
the other community members and all the other leaders, and also

777
00:41:05.176 --> 00:41:09.250
the Python Software Foundation to help your chapter.

778
00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:13.854
And that could change your mind, your mindset,

779
00:41:13.854 --> 00:41:16.790
your ideas, and that could change your.

780
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:19.628
So I want to invite everyone to be part of the

781
00:41:19.628 --> 00:41:24.076
community and to join us, even if you don't want,

782
00:41:24.076 --> 00:41:27.522
also an extra for the invitation,

783
00:41:27.522 --> 00:41:30.832
If you don't want to organize event, because I know

784
00:41:30.832 --> 00:41:33.216
that that takes time, or if you don't want to

785
00:41:33.216 --> 00:41:37.504
find a sponsorship or do the normal stuff that the

786
00:41:37.504 --> 00:41:41.568
people think that are behind of organizing a community, you

787
00:41:41.568 --> 00:41:44.548
can also create content, you can create an article, you

788
00:41:44.548 --> 00:41:47.652
can share with us what you did for the last

789
00:41:47.652 --> 00:41:50.916
production release that you accomplished, or what was a problem

790
00:41:50.916 --> 00:41:55.608
that you face between an integration between different frameworks that

791
00:41:55.608 --> 00:41:58.696
you are using in your work, at work or whatever,

792
00:41:58.696 --> 00:41:59.944
that you believe that

793
00:41:59.944 --> 00:42:02.168
okay, this took me time to

794
00:42:02.168 --> 00:42:04.302
investigate to find a solution.

795
00:42:04.302 --> 00:42:06.904
I'm going to create an article and I'm going to

796
00:42:06.904 --> 00:42:09.448
create this post, or I'm going to do this talk

797
00:42:09.448 --> 00:42:11.484
and I'm going to reach out my local community and

798
00:42:11.484 --> 00:42:13.788
I'm going to share that knowledge because that is going

799
00:42:13.788 --> 00:42:15.372
to save the time for others.

800
00:42:15.372 --> 00:42:20.448
And that is a really lovely sensation and feeling that

801
00:42:20.448 --> 00:42:24.384
you can say, okay, I did good, and that's it.

802
00:42:24.384 --> 00:42:27.136
And that will be your piece of help.

803
00:42:27.136 --> 00:42:30.048
And it will be really welcomed in the community, too.

804
00:42:30.048 --> 00:42:33.120
So this is an invitation for you to be part.

805
00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:36.324
That's awesome.

806
00:42:36.324 --> 00:42:38.800
And I thought I share that.

807
00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:42.548
That's a really great idea and that's really

808
00:42:42.548 --> 00:42:45.190
a great way to help the community.

809
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:47.208
I think the content from the

810
00:42:47.208 --> 00:42:49.380
community all comes from you.

811
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:53.080
You can start becoming the content of

812
00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:56.712
Python, learning Python or using community.

813
00:42:56.712 --> 00:43:01.282
And we have lots of conferences all over the world that's

814
00:43:01.282 --> 00:43:05.420
looking for talks about Python, and you can be the one

815
00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.708
giving the talk and you can totally do it.

816
00:43:07.708 --> 00:43:09.424
So I will pitch out.

817
00:43:09.424 --> 00:43:14.662
PyCon US 2024 is right now accepting talks.

818
00:43:14.662 --> 00:43:17.130
And if you have talk ideas,

819
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:19.980
listen to Karo submit a talk.

820
00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:23.130
And I know there are lots of other conferences

821
00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:26.388
going on as well, so not PyCon US.

822
00:43:26.388 --> 00:43:27.562
There are lots of Python

823
00:43:27.562 --> 00:43:30.858
conferences, lots of Python everywhere.

824
00:43:30.858 --> 00:43:35.176
Euro Python and PyCon APAC. Really,

825
00:43:35.176 --> 00:43:36.606
there's a lot of them everywhere.

826
00:43:36.606 --> 00:43:39.112
So give a talk.

827
00:43:39.112 --> 00:43:40.230
Yeah.

828
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:41.460
Thank you so much.

829
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.984
Yeah.

830
00:43:42.984 --> 00:43:44.062
Thank you so much, Karo.

831
00:43:44.062 --> 00:43:46.696
It's so nice chatting with you and so

832
00:43:46.696 --> 00:43:49.068
nice to share so much of your experience.

833
00:43:49.068 --> 00:43:51.308
Even I know you for a while.

834
00:43:51.308 --> 00:43:54.748
It's always refreshing to know more about how you

835
00:43:54.748 --> 00:43:57.820
manage and how you do this and that. It's great.

836
00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.080
So thank you so much.

837
00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:00.130
Bye.
