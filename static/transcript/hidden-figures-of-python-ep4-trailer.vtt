00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.710
Yay.

2
00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.209
So let's do the sequence

3
00:00:07.723 --> 00:00:09.494
The PyPodcats

4
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.204
it's to highlight

5
00:00:17.632 --> 00:00:20.390
How did you first get in contact with a computer?

6
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.181
I was five or six when I started playing.

7
00:00:24.182 --> 00:00:26.350
What age appropriate.

8
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.434
I want to say age appropriate video games.

9
00:00:30.534 --> 00:00:32.270
It was age appropriate.

10
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.484
I tried writing my first program in

11
00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:36.564
Python that just did something simple.

12
00:00:36.564 --> 00:00:40.044
I myself is totally blind, so I wanted to make

13
00:00:40.044 --> 00:00:43.564
a text editor where I could control the visual formatting.

14
00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:46.116
I read approximately twice as fast

15
00:00:46.116 --> 00:00:48.292
as an average human reader.

16
00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:50.756
I read around six to 700 words a minute.

17
00:00:50.756 --> 00:00:53.516
I've never seen a conference where they have

18
00:00:53.516 --> 00:00:56.492
this accessibility info readily available for what they

19
00:00:56.492 --> 00:00:59.834
do with people that has physical disabilities.

20
00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:01.786
I just wish that information

21
00:01:01.786 --> 00:01:03.562
was more readily available.

22
00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:06.322
Hi everyone, my name is Jessica Tegner.

23
00:01:06.322 --> 00:01:08.802
I am an open source maintainer.

24
00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:13.106
I maintain the popular Python project PyPandoc.

25
00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:15.770
I'm also a Computer Science student and I

26
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.186
am a conference speaker and I've traveled around

27
00:01:18.186 --> 00:01:21.058
the world doing conferences on everything from open

28
00:01:21.058 --> 00:01:23.650
source to diversity and inclusivity.

29
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.226
Hope to catch you all in the next

30
00:01:25.226 --> 00:01:29.214
episode of Hidden Figures of Python at PyPodcats.
