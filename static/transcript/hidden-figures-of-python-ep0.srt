1
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,252
We are the Podcats, and welcome to our very

2
00:00:26,253 --> 00:00:30,514
first podcast where we are going to introduce ourselves

3
00:00:30,515 --> 00:00:33,628
and talk a little bit about why we are

4
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:38,434
even doing yet another podcast, Hidden Figures of Python.

5
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:42,044
And we have announced it already on social media.

6
00:00:42,045 --> 00:00:43,644
And we are also going to address a

7
00:00:43,645 --> 00:00:46,650
little bit some of the responses we've had.

8
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:50,436
So with me today, we have Mariatta, Georgi,

9
00:00:50,437 --> 00:00:54,628
Cheuk, and we are all, all over the world.

10
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,682
So I'm Tereza, I live in Hamburg.

11
00:00:56,683 --> 00:00:58,234
I'm from Romania.

12
00:00:58,235 --> 00:01:02,132
I started PyLadies Hamburg long ago, and

13
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:04,558
I'm involved in several of the Python

14
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,182
Software foundation groups like Code of Conduct

15
00:01:07,183 --> 00:01:11,490
and Diversity and Inclusion. And, Mariatta?

16
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:13,512
Hi, everybody.

17
00:01:13,513 --> 00:01:14,846
My name is Mariatta.

18
00:01:14,847 --> 00:01:17,500
I'm in Vancouver, Canada, and

19
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:19,650
I'm a Python core developer.

20
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:23,234
I'm an open source maintainer and contributor.

21
00:01:23,235 --> 00:01:25,868
And I'm involved in the Python community in a

22
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:28,262
lot of ways, not only as the open source

23
00:01:28,263 --> 00:01:33,526
contributor, but also I run conferences, meetups.

24
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:37,230
I've been the chair of the PyCascades

25
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:40,048
I co founded the PyCascades Conference, and

26
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,800
I'm chairing PyCon US 2023 and 2024.

27
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,270
Go to you, Georgi.

28
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,268
Hello, everyone.

29
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:52,884
This is Georgi here.

30
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:54,850
I'm in Amsterdam.

31
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,326
So I'm actually a little bit everywhere.

32
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:04,318
So previously I've been living in Thailand and helped

33
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,532
out and organized and led PyCon Thailand, and also

34
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:15,650
Pycon APAC 2021, kind of not only Python related

35
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:21,136
events, but also several hackathons and, like Code War.

36
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:28,310
And I did organize RubyConf and co founded PyLadies.

37
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:34,820
And I've also actually been designing the websites for

38
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:39,870
PyCon and a few other main Python related events.

39
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,874
Passing the mic to Cheuk

40
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,122
Hello, I'm Cheuk.

41
00:02:44,123 --> 00:02:45,830
I live in London.

42
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:49,720
Usually I'm not home because I am a

43
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:51,890
speaker at a lot of different places.

44
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,086
Right now, I'm in Tokyo, Japan.

45
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:56,280
So, hello.

46
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,492
Also, I am currently at the PSF board.

47
00:03:02,493 --> 00:03:05,212
I've also been a PSF fellow since 2021.

48
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:10,384
And, yeah, I've been involved in a

49
00:03:10,385 --> 00:03:12,800
lot of work in the Python community. Yeah.

50
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:16,048
So I think maybe we should just explain a little

51
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:20,330
bit why we come up with the name Hidden figures.

52
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,468
So we have been searching around and finding a

53
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:29,730
lot of ideas, and Cheuk even came up with

54
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:35,704
something crazy called Espresso Orange Juice, which was actually

55
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:37,970
just simply what I like to drink.

56
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,400
That was one of the first idea.

57
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:45,262
And then eventually, I remember Mariatta

58
00:03:45,263 --> 00:03:46,990
came out with the "Hidden Figures".

59
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:48,984
So maybe Mariatta, you can explain

60
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:50,844
why it comes out with that.

61
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:52,870
You come up with that title?

62
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,000
Well, yeah, I guess it's really about

63
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,006
what are we doing in this podcast?

64
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:03,104
Like, what is the topic of this podcast is about?

65
00:04:03,105 --> 00:04:05,536
And I guess when we talk about it,

66
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:10,272
we wanted to highlight underrepresented group and women

67
00:04:10,273 --> 00:04:13,220
in the Python community because we felt their

68
00:04:13,221 --> 00:04:18,692
stories aren't being shared enough, or I think

69
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:22,266
they're not getting the recognition that they deserve.

70
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:25,112
And when thinking about that, it brought me to

71
00:04:25,113 --> 00:04:27,736
the stories, actually, there was a book about this

72
00:04:27,737 --> 00:04:32,616
and a movie that was a big hit, the

73
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:37,986
Hidden Figures, which was also highlighting stories of African

74
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:43,020
American women in NASA in the past.

75
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:46,892
And I thought, this relates so much to what we

76
00:04:46,893 --> 00:04:50,758
see in the Python community, and I thought, maybe let's

77
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:54,110
use the name the "Hidden Figures of Python".

78
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:54,512
Yeah.

79
00:04:54,513 --> 00:04:56,838
So it's not just about the title.

80
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:00,128
I think the idea came up, kind

81
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:04,340
of brew into what it is now.

82
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:13,064
Starting from PyCon US last year, which I seen, everybody's there,

83
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:15,912
there's like a big party, a lot of people very

84
00:05:15,913 --> 00:05:22,638
excited to see so many people and go to film

85
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,938
some podcasts while they meet some speaker or some guests

86
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:28,124
that they want to invite there in person.

87
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,900
So I think that's great.

88
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:34,796
But I have an observation about most of these

89
00:05:34,797 --> 00:05:39,110
guests or people who have been interviewed are male.

90
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:45,952
So for me, it feels like, of course, these people,

91
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:47,904
they have achieved a lot of things, they got a

92
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:50,300
lot of respect in the community, but I feel like,

93
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:54,666
are there any women at all who kind of achieved

94
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:59,028
same level of contribution, getting respect from the community, but

95
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:01,204
hasn't been featured for whatever reason?

96
00:06:01,205 --> 00:06:05,272
So that's why I think that we

97
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:07,032
need to do something about it.

98
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,838
So I talked to my good friends sitting

99
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,552
here, and they're all on board of this

100
00:06:12,553 --> 00:06:14,184
idea that we should do something.

101
00:06:14,185 --> 00:06:17,480
So that's kind of how it got into we want to do a

102
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:21,772
podcast, we find a good name for it and why we're here.

103
00:06:21,773 --> 00:06:23,308
So I think Georgi and I are in

104
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:26,706
the Diversity and Inclusion workgroup with the PSF.

105
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:34,262
And here one aspect is also visibility and also highlighting

106
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:39,648
role models, because another side effect of seeing a lot

107
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:44,432
of events and podcasts where there's mostly men talking or

108
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:47,268
doing things or being highlighted that they are doing it

109
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:50,036
makes it not very inviting sometimes. Right?

110
00:06:50,037 --> 00:06:52,100
And if for people that want to get started,

111
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:55,592
and they are from underrepresented groups in Tech or

112
00:06:55,593 --> 00:07:00,824
women, and if you don't really feel like you

113
00:07:00,825 --> 00:07:03,192
don't see role models, you don't really see that

114
00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:07,880
there is space for you, like an inviting space.

115
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,202
But I know once you start getting involved.

116
00:07:11,203 --> 00:07:12,588
So we have PyLadies, we have

117
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:15,298
all sorts of organizations in Python.

118
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:17,692
Once you start getting involved, you see that

119
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:20,358
there are people, there are role models.

120
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:22,940
It's just that it's not very obvious.

121
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,952
And I think, how do we make

122
00:07:27,953 --> 00:07:29,472
that a little bit more obvious? Right.

123
00:07:29,473 --> 00:07:31,988
So this is not about taking space from other people.

124
00:07:31,989 --> 00:07:32,356
Right?

125
00:07:32,357 --> 00:07:35,796
It's more about highlighting that the space

126
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:38,170
is a lot more diverse than it's.

127
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:41,492
Looking at the moment, if I can add.

128
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:44,168
I feel there is a lot

129
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:47,518
of power in highlighting role models.

130
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:50,552
For example, I could share my personal experience.

131
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,480
Like, when I went to PyCon for the first time

132
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:56,940
ever, I saw lots of speakers, men and women.

133
00:07:56,941 --> 00:08:02,028
When I go to speakers, even though I saw

134
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:05,260
lots of speakers, it was only when I saw

135
00:08:05,261 --> 00:08:09,602
another women, another women of color on stage.

136
00:08:09,603 --> 00:08:12,736
That's the moment that I feel inspired myself, that,

137
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:15,440
oh, maybe I want to be like her.

138
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:17,360
I want to be speaker, too.

139
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:20,388
And that kind of power, I did not

140
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:22,724
get it unless I actually see somebody.

141
00:08:22,725 --> 00:08:26,720
And I feel like there is responsibility in

142
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,876
community leaders to not only provide content, but

143
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:37,416
making sure you are highlighting diverse members to

144
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:40,936
be able to further inspire other people.

145
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,880
So that's what I want to get.

146
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:47,244
One thing, Tereza, you brought up about

147
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:50,520
this, and also Mariatta bringing this up.

148
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:55,452
I personally was a bit surprised when I

149
00:08:55,453 --> 00:09:00,480
actually started stepping up as the organizer, the

150
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:04,430
PyCon Thailand lead at the first time.

151
00:09:04,431 --> 00:09:08,566
The moment I took over this task,

152
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:11,650
I see that there were more women

153
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:16,110
that actually started joining and participating.

154
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,884
The year when I actually started, there was slightly better,

155
00:09:20,885 --> 00:09:25,512
maybe like three or four, I would say from 10%

156
00:09:25,513 --> 00:09:30,340
of female speakers, it increased to about 20%.

157
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:37,490
And now that the ball got rolling, PyCon Thailand

158
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:45,282
this year has about almost 50% female talk submission.

159
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:47,630
And that is amazing.

160
00:09:47,631 --> 00:09:50,048
And this is what I meant by it

161
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:52,998
is not because, or what we meant.

162
00:09:52,999 --> 00:09:55,232
It is not because there are

163
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:58,700
no female role models out there.

164
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,200
We just need support.

165
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,522
The moment when I was in PyCon,

166
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:08,538
us, we attended PyLadieslunch.

167
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:10,586
I mean, that's not only female,

168
00:10:10,587 --> 00:10:12,858
of course there are males joining.

169
00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:15,310
But it was so empowering.

170
00:10:15,311 --> 00:10:18,792
When you are there, the ladies who are so

171
00:10:18,793 --> 00:10:22,088
afraid to step up, actually have the courage to

172
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,856
step up and talk about their stories, talk about

173
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:29,116
how they went from zero to something to something

174
00:10:29,117 --> 00:10:32,828
that everyone knew but was not talked about.

175
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:34,732
And I think this is part of reason

176
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:37,530
why I said yes to this podcast.

177
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:37,932
Yeah.

178
00:10:37,933 --> 00:10:41,232
So I think it's a very good point of, you have

179
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:43,712
to have some role model there to take the lead.

180
00:10:43,713 --> 00:10:47,632
That's why I keep talking to organizers that, do

181
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:50,016
you have any women in your organizing team?

182
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:52,452
Not just as a volunteer that do some small

183
00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:55,252
tasks and stuff, they're actually in the, I would

184
00:10:55,253 --> 00:10:58,452
say a leadership role, that they're helping to make

185
00:10:58,453 --> 00:11:02,356
decision, helping to be in the discussion and stuff.

186
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:06,152
We need that because you can say all

187
00:11:06,153 --> 00:11:08,190
what you want, that we support diversity.

188
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:10,840
But even if it's so simple, right.

189
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:13,320
We are not talking about finding someone

190
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:16,440
who may be quite difficult to find.

191
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:20,658
It's just, well, this world has two gender.

192
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:22,242
Well, maybe more than two gender,

193
00:11:22,243 --> 00:11:25,190
but majority, there's two gender.

194
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,820
Even that finding, let's say, women,

195
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:32,220
to get involved, to be there.

196
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,768
Have you ever tried?

197
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:35,824
Have you do it?

198
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:37,376
Can you show that you have done it?

199
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:38,960
Actions speak louder than words.

200
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:41,424
You can't just say that you support diversity and just

201
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:44,692
keep onboarding people who look like you to be because

202
00:11:44,693 --> 00:11:46,532
you just feel more comfortable working with them.

203
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:50,372
So that brings us to the point where

204
00:11:50,373 --> 00:11:54,536
we want to find out why we keep

205
00:11:54,537 --> 00:11:57,576
seeing men appearing in podcasts and stuff.

206
00:11:57,577 --> 00:12:00,904
So, Mariatta volunteered to data research.

207
00:12:00,905 --> 00:12:03,780
So, Mariatta, do you want to talk a little bit about.

208
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,980
Think.

209
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:12,730
I guess we just didn't have data about it, right?

210
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,186
Personally, when I see podcast

211
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:17,746
series announced, I pay attention.

212
00:12:17,747 --> 00:12:24,096
I pay attention that it's men in a podcast, and

213
00:12:24,097 --> 00:12:26,576
the next week is men again and again and again.

214
00:12:26,577 --> 00:12:29,808
And I thought maybe I should come up with the

215
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:32,842
data, maybe we should actually collect so that it doesn't

216
00:12:32,843 --> 00:12:36,500
become just what Mariatta thinks and becomes real data.

217
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:40,612
And when I collected the data in September of

218
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:47,590
2023, I collected data from three popular podcasts.

219
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:49,688
And you can read the result in

220
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:53,410
our blog post, Pypodcats.live/blog.

221
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,604
It's a long URL, but find it basically what I found

222
00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:02,844
out of three different podcasts that's been going on for years

223
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:06,440
that has more than 100 episodes, each of them.

224
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:14,118
Out of those episodes, 666 episodes, women appeared

225
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:18,128
in only 17%, like 100 or so.

226
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:20,596
And it's not also that.

227
00:13:20,597 --> 00:13:23,156
There aren't 117 different women

228
00:13:23,157 --> 00:13:25,178
who appeared on the episodes.

229
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,748
Some women appear multiple times, so in

230
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:31,930
fact, there are only 90 something episodes.

231
00:13:31,931 --> 00:13:36,472
94, I believe, women out of

232
00:13:36,473 --> 00:13:41,940
540 guests, so also 17% women.

233
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,938
These podcasts are considered as top Python podcasts.

234
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:52,540
If you go to Google and you try to

235
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:57,218
look Python podcasts, these are in different search engines.

236
00:13:57,219 --> 00:13:58,784
I tried different ones.

237
00:13:58,785 --> 00:14:01,686
These three podcasts are the ones that appeared.

238
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:06,976
And I feel like, yes, they have different

239
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:11,242
reasons, maybe for doing their podcast, but appearing

240
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:14,852
on the podcast also comes with a power

241
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,524
to influence the Python community.

242
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:22,000
And why are women being highlighted there?

243
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,140
That's a question we're wondering, right?

244
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,648
Anyway, if you like to read the blog post?

245
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:30,790
We announced it earlier.

246
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,900
We got some comments about it.

247
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,380
Does anybody else want to add to those?

248
00:14:36,381 --> 00:14:38,604
Yeah, I wanted to add something.

249
00:14:38,605 --> 00:14:43,580
I think maybe this is just for myself, like when

250
00:14:43,581 --> 00:14:49,776
an established entity is inviting me to speak these days

251
00:14:49,777 --> 00:14:52,688
or to do something, and then I check the website

252
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:58,512
and they are already like, I'm not represented there.

253
00:14:58,513 --> 00:15:01,428
I usually get the feeling that, why

254
00:15:01,429 --> 00:15:03,040
are they writing to me now?

255
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,840
They want to improve their diversity numbers.

256
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,676
I think it's really hard in general for

257
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:14,574
something that has already been going in uncontrolled

258
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:19,006
direction to switch to being intentional about diversity.

259
00:15:19,007 --> 00:15:20,360
It's way more work.

260
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:23,380
So I think we have to acknowledge this

261
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:28,252
if they would start from scratch and try

262
00:15:28,253 --> 00:15:32,194
from the beginning to be representing more groups.

263
00:15:32,195 --> 00:15:39,116
So I think this might be also a reason why, because

264
00:15:39,117 --> 00:15:42,768
diversity conversations about diversity are fairly new, at least not in

265
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:44,496
the US, but in the rest of the world.

266
00:15:44,497 --> 00:15:47,968
I think being intentional about diversity in a lot

267
00:15:47,969 --> 00:15:54,004
of circles is not something that was done a

268
00:15:54,005 --> 00:15:55,684
lot in the past, so to say.

269
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:58,690
So I think for things that are already established,

270
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,920
there might be a little bit of an effect

271
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,688
that leads to them being finding it harder to

272
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:09,192
attract diverse speakers at this moment.

273
00:16:09,193 --> 00:16:12,660
So they will have to go the extra mile for that.

274
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:21,442
I also feel a little bit like sometimes people tend

275
00:16:21,443 --> 00:16:25,788
to run away from the name DNI or diversity and

276
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:29,142
inclusion because they say you're doing some kind of trend

277
00:16:29,143 --> 00:16:33,070
thing because you want to be part of the spotlight.

278
00:16:33,071 --> 00:16:36,368
So are you actually doing that for the reason

279
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:44,244
of being popular or being mentioned about, which also

280
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:48,132
kind of contradicting, you know what I mean?

281
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:49,988
It's like some people wants to be part of

282
00:16:49,989 --> 00:16:54,920
it because they invite other people that is from

283
00:16:54,921 --> 00:17:02,392
the minority groups or underrepresented groups and to just

284
00:17:02,393 --> 00:17:05,538
bring up and say, hey, we want to include

285
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:09,910
you, or simply put rainbow colors on their logo.

286
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,160
And do you really mean that?

287
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,116
That's the thing.

288
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,650
Do you really mean that you're doing diverse,

289
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:25,167
inviting a diverse and inclusive group, or are

290
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:29,936
you just being part of it to be

291
00:17:29,937 --> 00:17:37,476
the trend of 2021 or something like that?

292
00:17:37,477 --> 00:17:42,138
And this is something that I find some people tend

293
00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:44,132
to run away from, and at the same time, some

294
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:47,510
people wants to be that just for the spotlight.

295
00:17:47,511 --> 00:17:51,336
But rest assured, the four of us, I can

296
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:56,158
feel that it's totally because we feel that it's

297
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,644
like something is burning Inside your heart.

298
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,708
It's like you want to say something, but

299
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:05,564
you're just waiting, just waiting for someone to

300
00:18:05,565 --> 00:18:08,764
pop out to just make that difference.

301
00:18:08,765 --> 00:18:11,776
And we realize that we still don't see anyone.

302
00:18:11,777 --> 00:18:14,940
And that's why I say, you know what, let's just do it.

303
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,940
We can do it.

304
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,198
There's not going to be a tomorrow.

305
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,208
And I think that was part of

306
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:24,640
the reason why we are here too.

307
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,092
But I would like to add, wait

308
00:18:27,093 --> 00:18:28,436
a second, I would like to add.

309
00:18:28,437 --> 00:18:29,812
So I think I heard this

310
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:31,306
term, it's called purple washing.

311
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:33,732
When you're doing diversity for making it look

312
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:37,570
good, like you have green washing for environment.

313
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:43,336
I think at this point, if other groups or

314
00:18:43,337 --> 00:18:49,852
other podcasts, conferences, if they're doing diversity for all

315
00:18:49,853 --> 00:18:52,204
the wrong reasons, I also don't really care.

316
00:18:52,205 --> 00:18:56,572
As long as they're doing it, the work, the

317
00:18:56,573 --> 00:18:59,136
outcomes are still going to be valuable, right?

318
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:02,128
So I would say to everybody out there who

319
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:05,232
is thinking, okay, but what if my reasons are

320
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:09,648
marketing and make our podcast look good and whatever.

321
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,660
Yeah, it doesn't matter, just do it. Do the work.

322
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:16,154
The work is hard and have more diversity.

323
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,108
And yes it's going to have all sorts of

324
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:23,108
benefits, but you'll see the work is hard anyway.

325
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:24,000
I agree.

326
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,424
I personally see the numbers.

327
00:19:26,425 --> 00:19:28,952
I don't care what's the reason of doing it.

328
00:19:28,953 --> 00:19:33,528
But if the result is having more diverse, let's say

329
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:36,012
we can go back to Mariatta's research in a bit.

330
00:19:36,013 --> 00:19:38,732
Like, let's say the number of women being

331
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:41,772
invited or actually appearing in a podcast is

332
00:19:41,773 --> 00:19:45,772
increasing, then that's what I want to see. Right?

333
00:19:45,773 --> 00:19:47,932
I don't care if it's like

334
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:50,832
over spotlight, whatever, it's hard work.

335
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,726
I can tell you doing diversity

336
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:54,416
and inclusion work is hard work.

337
00:19:54,417 --> 00:19:56,614
It's not always get appreciated.

338
00:19:56,615 --> 00:19:59,536
It's doing something like sometimes you have to fight

339
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:02,148
against what is popular opinion and stuff, right?

340
00:20:02,149 --> 00:20:03,920
You have to fight against the current.

341
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:07,652
And even if someone started just want

342
00:20:07,653 --> 00:20:12,084
to, for whatever like quotation, wrong reason.

343
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:15,224
But as long as they put in the work, as long

344
00:20:15,225 --> 00:20:19,060
as we see the result, we should still appreciate that.

345
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,660
So let's go back to the numbers, maybe.

346
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,800
Well, I just wanted to mention though,

347
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,796
I don't know how to say that.

348
00:20:34,797 --> 00:20:39,132
I find it annoying if people say diversity is

349
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:44,064
doing diversity work is something trivial or something easy.

350
00:20:44,065 --> 00:20:45,856
You're doing it just because you

351
00:20:45,857 --> 00:20:47,430
want to get a spotlight.

352
00:20:47,431 --> 00:20:50,000
This is harder than writing code.

353
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:53,754
Writing code is very exact, it's factual.

354
00:20:53,755 --> 00:20:57,140
There's a formula that you can apply

355
00:20:57,141 --> 00:20:59,940
again and again to various code base.

356
00:20:59,941 --> 00:21:02,740
Like doing this kind of work is hard.

357
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:05,080
And personally for me, I really rather

358
00:21:05,081 --> 00:21:06,910
be writing code and writing bots.

359
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:09,048
But I care enough about this that I

360
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:11,940
want to be participated on this thing.

361
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:18,412
I give talks if I talk about my

362
00:21:18,413 --> 00:21:21,884
code, my bots, I feel very happy.

363
00:21:21,885 --> 00:21:24,748
I will be able to finish that talk in like a

364
00:21:24,749 --> 00:21:27,880
day or two, I'm done and I feel super happy.

365
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,622
But sometimes I talk about diversity,

366
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,136
I talk about the community.

367
00:21:33,137 --> 00:21:37,990
Those talks takes me at least two weeks to prepare.

368
00:21:37,991 --> 00:21:41,828
And then during the rehearsal of that talks, I

369
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:45,520
feel super sad and angry and not happy.

370
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,090
It's a lot of mental

371
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:52,234
burden being involved in diversity.

372
00:21:52,235 --> 00:21:56,264
And yeah, I find it annoying when people said,

373
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:59,688
oh, it's just diversity, as if it's easy.

374
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:02,770
Anyway, I'm just rambling.

375
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:06,162
No, I don't think it's rambling.

376
00:22:06,163 --> 00:22:07,560
I totally agree.

377
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,732
I think all of us here, all four

378
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:15,270
of us here has been through that stage.

379
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:20,832
I remember when I started creating just

380
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:26,448
simple meetups and month after month, I

381
00:22:26,449 --> 00:22:30,140
was literally the only female there.

382
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,730
And all the other attendees were male.

383
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:42,856
And someone just said, yeah, because

384
00:22:42,857 --> 00:22:44,340
female don't want to speak.

385
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:52,712
An interesting thing, one of the company's founders, he

386
00:22:52,713 --> 00:22:56,460
was saying that he was there because he just

387
00:22:56,461 --> 00:23:01,270
tried to get hire new Python developers.

388
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,396
And he said, you know what,

389
00:23:04,397 --> 00:23:07,110
I cannot find female developers.

390
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,620
I've been hiring, no one is there.

391
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,416
I step into his office one day and I look

392
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:21,570
around the office and there was literally like 90% men.

393
00:23:21,571 --> 00:23:24,932
Imagine if you are the single woman working there,

394
00:23:24,933 --> 00:23:30,420
do you feel comfortable, do you feel comfortable working

395
00:23:30,421 --> 00:23:33,444
there if you are the only one?

396
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,040
So I think there are many ways you can

397
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:40,056
make an effort to make a difference, not only

398
00:23:40,057 --> 00:23:43,416
doing the first step, which is super important, because

399
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:46,620
someone needs to have that difference there.

400
00:23:46,621 --> 00:23:55,212
And also, I mean, 2000% disagree that

401
00:23:55,213 --> 00:23:58,620
there's no female developers out there.

402
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:04,566
Yeah, I would like to grab that point and elaborate

403
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:07,980
a little bit, because it's not just a workplace, right?

404
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,088
As you can see, the response from one of the

405
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:15,002
podcast organizer and from other event organizers as well, I've

406
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:18,292
seen this many, many times that they are thinking like,

407
00:24:18,293 --> 00:24:22,308
well, we just choose speaker regardless of gender, we just

408
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:24,980
choose whoever we think is great.

409
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:30,536
But the point is, I think usually

410
00:24:30,537 --> 00:24:32,710
it's a point that got overlooked.

411
00:24:32,711 --> 00:24:36,242
I want to believe that nobody do it on purpose

412
00:24:36,243 --> 00:24:42,812
too, but people miss the point that actually now we

413
00:24:42,813 --> 00:24:44,988
are not like men and women are not.

414
00:24:44,989 --> 00:24:49,302
Well, we are talking about in general now that's

415
00:24:49,303 --> 00:24:53,638
not in a level playing field, because young boys

416
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:57,654
have more access, more encouraged to do something technical,

417
00:24:57,655 --> 00:25:01,830
to play with computer, play with computer games versus

418
00:25:01,831 --> 00:25:05,172
young girl may get less exposure to those, they

419
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:07,730
may not be encouraged.

420
00:25:07,731 --> 00:25:09,040
It's just a fact.

421
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:14,788
So saying that we just chose someone regardless of the

422
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:18,088
gender, I think is a bit kind of overseeing the

423
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:23,608
fact that we are not actually start from the same

424
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:29,276
level, because by the time look at how many who

425
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:34,252
choose the STEM object versus because why now there's more

426
00:25:34,253 --> 00:25:38,144
female university students, but still not a lot of them

427
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:42,060
choose to study science study.

428
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:51,338
Actually, I read on this data one time in Asia

429
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:55,600
and it's a very interesting data that I've seen.

430
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:06,840
There are more female working as doctors, scientists and

431
00:26:06,841 --> 00:26:12,530
all science and chemistry related and also data related

432
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:21,370
job, but apparently related to it was much lower.

433
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:24,156
But back then, years before even

434
00:26:24,157 --> 00:26:27,990
my partner's mom was actually coding.

435
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,328
So what happened there?

436
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:33,280
That's a very interesting question,

437
00:26:33,281 --> 00:26:34,832
like what happened there?

438
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:37,728
And I see that some of the Asians family,

439
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:43,082
they also feel like, oh, because being a doctor

440
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:48,430
is well regarded, being a scientist is well regarded.

441
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:54,632
There was something very interesting that after reading this

442
00:26:54,633 --> 00:26:58,990
data, I was like, so what happened is developer

443
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:05,512
something that sounds different, more different than scientists and

444
00:27:05,513 --> 00:27:09,426
doctors and chemists and et cetera.

445
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,244
I don't know if it has to

446
00:27:11,245 --> 00:27:12,978
do much with being well regarded.

447
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:14,844
So the way I read about it, at

448
00:27:14,845 --> 00:27:18,352
least in the west, what happened was that

449
00:27:18,353 --> 00:27:23,340
to programming, it just became a powerful job.

450
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:28,112
And it's just how you have

451
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:29,856
class system, you have gender system.

452
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:34,132
It's just our society is pushing the privilege of

453
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:37,450
power on the people that usually have that privilege.

454
00:27:37,451 --> 00:27:42,320
So then you have, it became so women didn't get

455
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,936
pushed, they got pushed out, out of the job.

456
00:27:46,937 --> 00:27:50,238
So it's not like in the end, there's all sorts

457
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:53,416
of ways in a society how you push a whole

458
00:27:53,417 --> 00:27:58,172
group out of something, I guess media and everything, that

459
00:27:58,173 --> 00:28:00,268
at the end you think it was another narrative, but

460
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:02,092
in the end that's what really happened, right?

461
00:28:02,093 --> 00:28:05,532
So it's been prestigious, like

462
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:07,516
financially speaking, a powerful job.

463
00:28:07,517 --> 00:28:11,312
And then it just went to the people that usually have

464
00:28:11,313 --> 00:28:16,326
the power in our society still just wanted to come round

465
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:21,312
out, so a little bit in case everybody forgot, right?

466
00:28:21,313 --> 00:28:25,780
So Mariatta did research, published a blog post.

467
00:28:25,781 --> 00:28:28,730
We also reached out to the podcast organizers

468
00:28:28,731 --> 00:28:32,132
to say, hey, we're going to publish this.

469
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:33,520
Do you have anything to.

470
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,224
And someone, one replied, right?

471
00:28:37,225 --> 00:28:40,248
And I think some of the replies are

472
00:28:40,249 --> 00:28:42,100
also in public, they're on social media.

473
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,188
And yeah, maybe we wanted to take the

474
00:28:46,189 --> 00:28:49,532
rest of the podcast to discuss a little

475
00:28:49,533 --> 00:28:51,586
bit this, right, like what was the replies?

476
00:28:51,587 --> 00:28:57,452
I'm also maybe to say for the future in general from

477
00:28:57,453 --> 00:29:00,768
diversity work is like, how do you reply when you did?

478
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:01,660
Maybe something.

479
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,416
What would be a good way to reply for people

480
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:09,462
who want to reply usually say in diversity and inclusion.

481
00:29:09,463 --> 00:29:11,844
When you did something to offend someone

482
00:29:11,845 --> 00:29:15,668
accidentally or not, you apologize and you

483
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:16,932
say, I will do better next time.

484
00:29:16,933 --> 00:29:22,160
So that is the gracious way of replying, when

485
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,608
in our case, the data does show that there

486
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:28,340
has been a clear trend in one direction and

487
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:32,062
justifying is sometimes not really helpful.

488
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:35,646
It also makes other people feel bad afterwards.

489
00:29:35,647 --> 00:29:36,936
Right? Yeah.

490
00:29:36,937 --> 00:29:41,276
I think Mariatta already established a point that when we

491
00:29:41,277 --> 00:29:45,500
do this research, we just like, out of curiosity, and

492
00:29:45,501 --> 00:29:48,386
we chose these podcasts because they are popular.

493
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:50,326
So first of all, congratulations.

494
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:52,518
If you got chosen, you are popular.

495
00:29:52,519 --> 00:30:00,048
But I would always give them the kind

496
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:02,788
of thing that it may be oversight. Right?

497
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:04,930
Again, it may be oversight.

498
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:06,930
Benefit of doubt.

499
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:08,788
Yeah, I don't want to use that word

500
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:11,668
because usually that word means that we are

501
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:14,152
accusing someone, but we are not.

502
00:30:14,153 --> 00:30:20,398
But yeah, I think that it may be an oversight, and it's

503
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:24,040
good that we bring it up and have a discussion, so maybe

504
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:27,210
we will figure out how to make it better together.

505
00:30:27,211 --> 00:30:29,548
Yeah, I think I also want to point out

506
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:32,732
that we are not actually trying to pinpoint at

507
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:37,132
any podcast here or anyone that is among the

508
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:41,350
community, which is really not our intention.

509
00:30:41,351 --> 00:30:45,568
We just want to figure out why is that?

510
00:30:45,569 --> 00:30:48,352
Just like what Mariatta said, not just out from

511
00:30:48,353 --> 00:30:52,260
Mariatta's head, nor Georgi's head, nor Tereza's head, or

512
00:30:52,261 --> 00:30:56,580
Cheuk's perception that there are lesser women.

513
00:30:56,581 --> 00:31:06,390
So data speaks the truth. and I personally

514
00:31:06,391 --> 00:31:10,630
It's not only, to be honest, not only female.

515
00:31:10,631 --> 00:31:12,232
I would even support that.

516
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:16,738
We will invite underrepresented folks.

517
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:21,052
And I grew up with people who

518
00:31:21,053 --> 00:31:27,788
are misrepresented many times, especially like the

519
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:31,680
gays, the lesbians, and all this.

520
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:38,736
And I think they are just as human as any one of us.

521
00:31:38,737 --> 00:31:40,198
I'm not going to make any judgment,

522
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:42,106
and we are not making any judgment.

523
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:43,972
I'm just going to make it simple to say

524
00:31:43,973 --> 00:31:47,764
that we are simply drawing out information and data

525
00:31:47,765 --> 00:31:50,560
and we are not pinpointing anyone else.

526
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,282
I would also like to. Yeah, or Mariatta said.

527
00:31:54,283 --> 00:31:55,940
Sorry, go ahead.

528
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,904
I guess I just want to mention, I feel

529
00:31:58,905 --> 00:32:01,928
encouraged by the story that we have even in

530
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:05,320
the Python and PyCon community, because at one point,

531
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:08,472
if you go to our about page, at one

532
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:13,180
point, the PyCon speakers were like 99% all men.

533
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:17,750
It's just 1% is woman speakers.

534
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,400
But it's got better over the years

535
00:32:20,401 --> 00:32:23,280
because there are several groups of people

536
00:32:23,281 --> 00:32:26,336
who intentionally try to make it better.

537
00:32:26,337 --> 00:32:28,672
It starts with identifying, oh,

538
00:32:28,673 --> 00:32:30,176
there's not enough women here.

539
00:32:30,177 --> 00:32:31,908
What are we going to do about it?

540
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:34,938
And actually doing something, highlighting

541
00:32:34,939 --> 00:32:36,212
the importance of it.

542
00:32:36,213 --> 00:32:39,226
And over the years, this got improved.

543
00:32:39,227 --> 00:32:43,652
And I think this is what we are trying to do here.

544
00:32:43,653 --> 00:32:46,222
We want to start by highlighting

545
00:32:46,223 --> 00:32:48,856
that there is an issue here.

546
00:32:48,857 --> 00:32:51,016
What are we doing, what can we do,

547
00:32:51,017 --> 00:32:54,136
and what can you all do? From us,

548
00:32:54,137 --> 00:32:57,452
We're trying to just highlight more women and

549
00:32:57,453 --> 00:33:00,396
underrepresented group members in the Python community.

550
00:33:00,397 --> 00:33:03,370
So maybe there are other ways of

551
00:33:03,371 --> 00:33:05,052
what you can do as well.

552
00:33:05,053 --> 00:33:07,210
So go ahead, Tereza.

553
00:33:07,211 --> 00:33:14,102
Yeah, I just wanted to add that maybe for me personally,

554
00:33:14,103 --> 00:33:16,080
I don't really need to focus so much on the why.

555
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:18,768
I mean, there's all sorts of whys, and some of

556
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:26,580
them are not really constructive for moving forward, but rather

557
00:33:26,581 --> 00:33:30,880
focus on what can we do to make it better.

558
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:37,336
So I think for conferences, all of us here

559
00:33:37,337 --> 00:33:41,864
have organized conferences, different conferences, and then in a

560
00:33:41,865 --> 00:33:43,672
lot of places there were quotas, right?

561
00:33:43,673 --> 00:33:48,568
I mean, it's like, hey, some conference they said, we

562
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:50,444
want to have this kind of diversity, and then we

563
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,322
also want to have this other kind of diversity.

564
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:53,388
And those were like, at the

565
00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:56,636
beginning, before speakers were selected, right?

566
00:33:56,637 --> 00:33:58,600
So not after.

567
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,586
Oh, we found all the men's speakers.

568
00:34:01,587 --> 00:34:03,558
We found like ten men's speakers.

569
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,976
Now we need to look for women

570
00:34:04,977 --> 00:34:06,480
as well or something like that.

571
00:34:06,481 --> 00:34:08,047
I've seen that also happening. Right.

572
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:12,110
But that's a little bit like the wrong direction,

573
00:34:12,111 --> 00:34:14,964
I think, starting from like, hey, what is the

574
00:34:14,965 --> 00:34:16,356
end result that you want to have?

575
00:34:16,357 --> 00:34:18,532
And then how do we get there?

576
00:34:18,533 --> 00:34:21,652
Or how do we encourage more to come in?

577
00:34:21,653 --> 00:34:22,420
Yeah.

578
00:34:22,421 --> 00:34:26,152
So we can use this podcast as a platform

579
00:34:26,153 --> 00:34:29,527
to highlight that there is an amazing amount of

580
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:34,989
awesome people from all sorts of intersections of diversity

581
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,266
in the world that are doing Python.

582
00:34:37,267 --> 00:34:41,681
And they have really successful stories and less successful

583
00:34:41,682 --> 00:34:44,668
stories, direct or non direct, to get to where

584
00:34:44,669 --> 00:34:47,320
they got that they will share with us.

585
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:50,368
And then all these people can then be

586
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:52,768
invited and all the other podcasts because we

587
00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:54,176
found them, we are helping out.

588
00:34:54,177 --> 00:34:54,880
Exactly.

589
00:34:54,881 --> 00:34:57,088
Actually, that is the point.

590
00:34:57,089 --> 00:35:00,656
And I think you will see us very

591
00:35:00,657 --> 00:35:03,882
soon with all the invited list of speakers.

592
00:35:03,883 --> 00:35:06,740
We are really excited and we have already

593
00:35:06,741 --> 00:35:10,522
gotten quite a few responses of the speakers

594
00:35:10,523 --> 00:35:11,642
that we are going to invite.

595
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:16,110
So stay tuned to our podcats.

596
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,758
Meow.

597
00:35:17,759 --> 00:35:19,352
So if you want to send us

598
00:35:19,353 --> 00:35:25,140
any message, meow@pypodcats.live

599
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:29,240
And that's how you can actually catch us.

600
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:32,360
And maybe if you want to speak on

601
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:36,044
one of our episodes, just write to us.

602
00:35:36,045 --> 00:35:42,090
Also, even if this would be your first podcast podcast,

603
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:47,792
this would be a very first time friendly platform.

604
00:35:47,793 --> 00:35:50,836
Also, if you're looking for female speaker. Yeah.

605
00:35:50,837 --> 00:35:52,404
If you are looking for a

606
00:35:52,405 --> 00:35:55,390
female speaker, panelist, keynote speaker.

607
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,920
You know where to look.

608
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:01,514
I promise, all of our guests are great. I promise.

609
00:36:01,515 --> 00:36:04,488
So, yeah, until today, you could say there are

610
00:36:04,489 --> 00:36:07,806
no women speakers out there, no women doing Python.

611
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:08,664
Until today.

612
00:36:08,665 --> 00:36:15,966
But from now on, there won't be any more excuses.

613
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:18,200
Yes, I should mention that.

614
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:22,732
I want to mention that we follow the PSF code

615
00:36:22,733 --> 00:36:29,862
of conduct in this community in the pypodcats episodes.

616
00:36:29,863 --> 00:36:34,230
Basically, the PyPodcats hosts and guests and commenters

617
00:36:34,231 --> 00:36:37,206
are bound by the PSF Code of Conduct.

618
00:36:37,207 --> 00:36:40,394
And as well as we are actually supported

619
00:36:40,395 --> 00:36:44,788
by the PSF, all our episodes will be

620
00:36:44,789 --> 00:36:47,760
published on the PSF's YouTube channel.

621
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:52,148
And because of the Code of Conduct, we hope

622
00:36:52,149 --> 00:36:57,640
that this encourage more participations from underrepresented group members

623
00:36:57,641 --> 00:37:00,638
who might feel that, well, they might get attacked

624
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,864
if they appear on Internet and things like that.

625
00:37:03,865 --> 00:37:07,240
So we are really something we care about.

626
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:11,660
I think.

627
00:37:11,661 --> 00:37:15,202
Thank you Python Software foundation for supporting

628
00:37:15,203 --> 00:37:19,292
us, because it doesn't come from zero.

629
00:37:19,293 --> 00:37:20,828
We also need some support.

630
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:22,076
All this takes time.

631
00:37:22,077 --> 00:37:23,080
All this takes.

632
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:26,322
Yep.

633
00:37:26,323 --> 00:37:28,012
Thank you, PSF, for everything.

634
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:30,900
Thank you for your attention and

635
00:37:30,901 --> 00:37:32,750
see you in the next podcast.

636
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,430
Bye bye.

637
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,590
Adios.

638
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:37,530
Bye.
