1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,721
It's been a great change to

2
00:00:06,722 --> 00:00:08,753
what I'm used to in Zimbabwe.

3
00:00:08,754 --> 00:00:11,433
When you say, I want to buy a bed, you buy a bed that

4
00:00:11,434 --> 00:00:13,945
is completely already assembled with a mattress.

5
00:00:13,946 --> 00:00:15,457
But I was shocked to find out

6
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,081
the bed comes in a box and,

7
00:00:17,082 --> 00:00:18,953
you have to, like, assemble everything.

8
00:00:18,954 --> 00:00:20,321
I had to buy a drill.

9
00:00:20,322 --> 00:00:23,845
I now have a screwdriver, and I have a hammer.

10
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:26,161
We don't have to mention the name, but

11
00:00:26,162 --> 00:00:28,217
if we see, let's say, like, Swedish furniture,

12
00:00:28,218 --> 00:00:30,825
we know you have to assemble it yourself.

13
00:00:30,826 --> 00:00:34,245
You're just learning, and already you're contributing

14
00:00:34,246 --> 00:00:36,325
back to the community, you're leading.

15
00:00:36,326 --> 00:00:38,246
the Django Girls, you know,

16
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,021
I felt like a beginner.

17
00:00:40,022 --> 00:00:41,869
I couldn't understand, like, most of

18
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,305
the things they were talking about.

19
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:46,277
I couldn't understand things that are

20
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:48,053
going on at DjangoCon

21
00:00:48,054 --> 00:00:51,269
We traveled, like, 33 hours by road to get there.

22
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,949
There were other women who were,

23
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:55,533
like, almost my age or younger.

24
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:56,869
Then there were mature women who

25
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:58,917
were, like, older than me, almost.

26
00:00:58,918 --> 00:01:00,733
Almost like the same age as my

27
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:03,293
mother, you know, who were learning to. Yeah.

28
00:01:03,294 --> 00:01:03,717
Who were Learning.

29
00:01:03,718 --> 00:01:04,968
Python and Django through

30
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:06,793
a Django Girls workshop.

31
00:01:06,794 --> 00:01:09,753
I was surprised when I walked into the room

32
00:01:09,754 --> 00:01:11,913
for the first time and I could count the

33
00:01:11,914 --> 00:01:13,553
women who were there at the event.

34
00:01:13,554 --> 00:01:15,945
And that's when I realized what Django Girls

35
00:01:15,946 --> 00:01:19,001
means to the tech community globally, not just

36
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:21,369
for me as a Zimbabwean in Zimbabwe.

37
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,273
Hi, everyone.

38
00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:24,185
My name is Anna Makarudze.

39
00:01:24,186 --> 00:01:26,825
I'm the fundraising coordinator for Django Girls.

40
00:01:26,826 --> 00:01:29,305
I'm excited to be here at PyPodcats.

41
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:31,185
So I'll be talking about my work with

42
00:01:31,186 --> 00:01:34,157
Django Girls foundation, as well as my journey

43
00:01:34,158 --> 00:01:35,485
and my work within the community.
