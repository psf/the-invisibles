00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.754
I went to a PyLadies event in Vancouver.

2
00:00:07.754 --> 00:00:10.228
The vibe was completely different from any

3
00:00:10.228 --> 00:00:12.020
other programming meetup I'd ever been to.

4
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.108
I did not feel like I was

5
00:00:13.108 --> 00:00:15.604
being tested or anything like that.

6
00:00:15.604 --> 00:00:18.148
even though I felt very new, people were

7
00:00:18.148 --> 00:00:19.898
just saying like, yeah, just make a five minute

8
00:00:19.898 --> 00:00:22.196
talk about whatever you're learning and come back.

9
00:00:22.196 --> 00:00:24.596
I got involved with it because it was there because

10
00:00:24.596 --> 00:00:26.924
Python has a community in a way that you

11
00:00:26.924 --> 00:00:29.618
can't really necessarily say to the same extent.

12
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.582
The title is tricky executive editor.

13
00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:46.176
No one knows what that means.

14
00:00:46.176 --> 00:00:47.790
That sounds big.

15
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.832
Yeah, it either sounds very big or very small.

16
00:00:50.832 --> 00:00:52.774
Sometimes people see the word editor and they're

17
00:00:52.774 --> 00:00:54.128
like, oh, this is the lady that does

18
00:00:54.128 --> 00:00:55.606
the spell check on my tutorial.

19
00:00:55.606 --> 00:00:57.402
I similarly was self taught.

20
00:00:57.402 --> 00:01:00.068
And so, like, yeah, I paid for some courses, but a lot

21
00:01:00.068 --> 00:01:02.202
of it was just like, well, things are on the Internet.

22
00:01:02.202 --> 00:01:02.900
I'll go learn.

23
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.058
I learned from the Internet.

24
00:01:04.058 --> 00:01:05.588
I'm now providing to the Internet, and

25
00:01:05.588 --> 00:01:07.124
other people will learn as well. Yeah.

26
00:01:07.124 --> 00:01:08.138
My name is Mariatta

27
00:01:08.138 --> 00:01:10.346
I'm one of the hosts for PyPodcats.

28
00:01:10.346 --> 00:01:13.402
I'm based in Vancouver, Canada, and my name is Tereza.

29
00:01:13.402 --> 00:01:15.612
I am also one of the PyPodcats

30
00:01:15.612 --> 00:01:18.386
host, and I'm based in Hamburg, Germany.

31
00:01:18.386 --> 00:01:21.788
All right, I'm Joanna Jablonski, and I've been

32
00:01:21.788 --> 00:01:23.852
involved in the Python community since, I think,

33
00:01:23.852 --> 00:01:26.850
2016, and I'm also based in Vancouver, Canada.
