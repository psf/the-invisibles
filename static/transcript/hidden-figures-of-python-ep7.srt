1
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,881
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:21,882 --> 00:00:24,609
New PyPodcats again. Here today.

3
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,331
We have, we are so excited because we have Anna

4
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:30,795
from the Django Girls Foundation to be with us.

5
00:00:30,796 --> 00:00:35,451
And so you have already seen Mariatta and I'm Cheuk

6
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,907
and we are the host of the PyPodcats.

7
00:00:37,908 --> 00:00:40,243
So for Anna, I think it's the best if you

8
00:00:40,244 --> 00:00:42,979
can introduce yourself because we really want to know about

9
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,131
you and I don't want to miss anything.

10
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:45,939
Hi, Cheuk.

11
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,099
Hi, Mariatta.

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,043
I'm so excited to be here.

13
00:00:49,044 --> 00:00:50,187
Thank you for having me.

14
00:00:50,188 --> 00:00:53,003
So my name is Anna Makarudze.

15
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:56,459
I'm the current Django Girls fundraising coordinator, a

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,287
position that I've held since June 2017.

17
00:00:59,288 --> 00:01:02,271
And I'm also a trustee for the Board

18
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:05,431
of Trustees for Django Girls Foundation and also

19
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,471
Software Engineer for Django Girls foundation since August

20
00:01:08,472 --> 00:01:11,399
2020 when there was a transition in leadership.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,743
I also support the Django Girls website and

22
00:01:14,744 --> 00:01:17,823
the other resources in the GitHub repo.

23
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,943
So I'm kind of like the lead maintainer for the

24
00:01:20,944 --> 00:01:25,399
website and also work with volunteers to maintain our resources

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,663
because the website and the tutorial in our coaches manual,

26
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:32,051
organizer manual, they are all open source.

27
00:01:32,052 --> 00:01:34,651
So we work with volunteers to maintain them,

28
00:01:34,652 --> 00:01:36,419
to make sure that they are kept up

29
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,735
to date and accessible to the general public.

30
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:44,451
Yeah, I have heard some so much like exciting

31
00:01:44,452 --> 00:01:47,019
news from Django Girls like earlier this year.

32
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,555
So I know now we are Django Girls plus.

33
00:01:50,556 --> 00:01:51,855
Yes. Yes.

34
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:57,055
It was addition that the board of trustees made

35
00:01:57,056 --> 00:01:59,791
because over the years we're being asked if we

36
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:03,839
were inclusive of trans women and LGBQT.

37
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,663
So it was just easier to add a 'plus'

38
00:02:06,664 --> 00:02:10,447
to our name without really changing our the known

39
00:02:10,448 --> 00:02:12,015
name that we've had for 10 years.

40
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:13,775
As you know, we turned ten this year.

41
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:15,903
So yeah, it was a win for us.

42
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:18,935
So we, over the years we've tried to change

43
00:02:18,936 --> 00:02:20,799
the language on our website to show that we

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,423
are inclusive of everyone who identifies as a woman.

45
00:02:23,424 --> 00:02:28,495
So that was the idea behind the name change.

46
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:30,343
Yeah, I'm so happy to see that.

47
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:32,871
And you will be very busy and I know

48
00:02:32,872 --> 00:02:35,679
you also personally have to make a big change.

49
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,327
You're moving country.

50
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:39,375
Can you tell us a little bit about that?

51
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:43,079
So I've moved from Zimbabwe to

52
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,151
Sweden for my Master's studies.

53
00:02:46,152 --> 00:02:49,287
I'll be studying software engineering at Blekinge

54
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:52,937
Institute of Technology in Karlskrona, Sweden.

55
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:56,943
So I left Zimbabwe on the 14th of August and I'll

56
00:02:56,944 --> 00:03:00,955
be starting school on the on Monday the 2nd of September.

57
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:03,383
Are you excited?

58
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:04,839
Yes, I am.

59
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,835
So that's when we have our introduction day.

60
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:11,783
I get to learn more about the program, as well as

61
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:16,671
meet my classmates as well as my lecturers and professors.

62
00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:19,993
So, yeah, I'm excited for that and it's been

63
00:03:19,994 --> 00:03:22,641
a great change to what I'm used to.

64
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:23,489
Yeah.

65
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,205
Yeah.

66
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,209
Because when you.

67
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,841
In Zimbabwe, when you say, I want to

68
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:29,561
buy a bed, you buy a bed that

69
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:32,585
is complete, already assembled with a mattress.

70
00:03:32,586 --> 00:03:34,793
But I was shocked to find out. Yeah.

71
00:03:34,794 --> 00:03:36,249
You buy a bed separately and

72
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,833
then you buy a mattress separately.

73
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:38,241
Yeah.

74
00:03:38,242 --> 00:03:39,769
And the base comes in a box

75
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,045
and you have to, like, assemble everything.

76
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:44,841
So I had to buy a drill.

77
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:47,241
I now have a screwdriver, and I have

78
00:03:47,242 --> 00:03:48,445
I have a hammer.

79
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:50,885
Yeah, the Swedish furniture.

80
00:03:50,886 --> 00:03:52,461
We know, like, we don't have to mention the

81
00:03:52,462 --> 00:03:54,437
name, but if we see, let's say, like Swedish

82
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:57,145
furniture, we know you have to assemble it yourself.

83
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,865
That's how it works.

84
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:02,225
Yeah.

85
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:05,333
So, it was, the shock for me, I.

86
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:06,901
I thought I ordered two pieces of

87
00:04:06,902 --> 00:04:08,905
furniture and I get two boxes.

88
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:11,785
It's like, oh, this is my bed. You sure?

89
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:15,949
But you are now very good with

90
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,785
hardware as well, so that's good.

91
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:21,141
Hardware and software, we can do everything.

92
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:21,380
Yeah.

93
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:22,641
It's really been a learning curve.

94
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:22,905
So.

95
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:23,217
Yeah.

96
00:04:23,218 --> 00:04:25,233
And it took me days. Yeah.

97
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:26,361
But I'm getting there now.

98
00:04:26,362 --> 00:04:28,625
So I am glad that I had time for this

99
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:30,649
because I came about two weeks earlier than when I

100
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,657
was supposed to start, so I had time to go

101
00:04:33,658 --> 00:04:36,697
through these new changes, you know, patiently.

102
00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:39,081
I didn't get frustrated because I wasn't in a rush.

103
00:04:39,082 --> 00:04:39,409
Yeah.

104
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,353
It would have been something else if I

105
00:04:41,354 --> 00:04:42,977
arrived just in the nick of time when

106
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:44,337
I was supposed to start my program.

107
00:04:44,338 --> 00:04:45,865
So, yeah, it has been a good

108
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:47,805
change, but I'm looking forward to it.

109
00:04:48,395 --> 00:04:49,595
Yeah, that's good.

110
00:04:49,596 --> 00:04:50,811
That's exciting.

111
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:52,895
Yeah, I'm glad for you.

112
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:54,563
Yeah.

113
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:55,895
Tell us more about.

114
00:04:56,635 --> 00:05:00,987
You mentioned you're doing software engineer lead for

115
00:05:00,988 --> 00:05:04,563
Django Girls, because I think that's really interesting.

116
00:05:04,564 --> 00:05:08,371
I know the Django Girls tutorials is one

117
00:05:08,372 --> 00:05:10,739
of the resources I like to share for

118
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,115
people who are learning Python, learning Django.

119
00:05:14,116 --> 00:05:16,251
So it's really useful resources.

120
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:17,995
Can you tell us more about

121
00:05:17,996 --> 00:05:20,099
this new role within Django Girls?

122
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,095
What do you do?

123
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:23,559
Okay, so the tutorial is a

124
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,687
bit separate from the website.

125
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:28,711
I normally work on the website, I'm maintaining

126
00:05:28,712 --> 00:05:32,775
it, making code changes, fixing bugs, and then

127
00:05:32,776 --> 00:05:35,815
I'm also in charge of deployment as well

128
00:05:35,816 --> 00:05:39,855
as adding new contributors to the website.

129
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:42,383
Then with the tutorial, every now and then, I

130
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:47,019
also contribute to it, like introducing new changes.

131
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,043
For some time, we're offering, we added a section where

132
00:05:50,044 --> 00:05:53,587
people could learn on the cloud using RunCode.

133
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:55,571
They were giving us the platform for free.

134
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:57,035
But we have since removed it.

135
00:05:57,036 --> 00:05:58,483
Now because it's no longer

136
00:05:58,484 --> 00:05:59,955
available, people have to pay.

137
00:05:59,956 --> 00:06:02,419
So we try to make sure that

138
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,131
we have the things that we mentioned.

139
00:06:04,132 --> 00:06:05,299
The resources that we mention in the

140
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,091
tutorial are free for the participants.

141
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:10,691
So because it's no longer free, we removed that.

142
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:13,963
So every now and then, if they say, I

143
00:06:13,964 --> 00:06:18,091
wanted to restructure the tutorial actually, but it's huge.

144
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:23,255
So the first pull request that I did, it was a bit big.

145
00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:25,367
It took time to have people review it.

146
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:27,527
What we've been trying to do is to

147
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:29,479
shorten it by making sure that if you're

148
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,119
on Windows, you follow Windows instructions.

149
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,159
If you're on Linux, you follow Linux.

150
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,591
If you're on iOS, on Mac, you follow Mac instructions.

151
00:06:39,592 --> 00:06:42,391
But because everything is so mumbled up and it's a

152
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:45,429
long tutorial, it's difficult to do it in stages.

153
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,701
But at the same time, if you do

154
00:06:46,702 --> 00:06:48,685
a large pull request and it takes time

155
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:52,357
without being reviewed, it gets overtaken by events.

156
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:53,805
So now I'll.

157
00:06:53,806 --> 00:06:55,261
I think I'll have to start again.

158
00:06:55,262 --> 00:06:56,741
But that's something that we have

159
00:06:56,742 --> 00:06:58,645
wanted to do for some time.

160
00:06:58,646 --> 00:07:00,501
If I can get people to work with, we would

161
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:03,301
want to do that, to separate the instructions so that

162
00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:07,061
our participants are not confused by having to read through

163
00:07:07,062 --> 00:07:09,237
so many notes that really don't affect them.

164
00:07:09,238 --> 00:07:10,821
If you're on Windows, you don't need to know

165
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:13,911
about a note about Ubuntu or about Mac.

166
00:07:13,912 --> 00:07:16,677
And the same applies to those on Ubuntu and Mac.

167
00:07:16,678 --> 00:07:18,445
They don't need to know about Windows.

168
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:19,973
It would actually make it easier for

169
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:21,605
participants if they just yet to go

170
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:23,813
through what is platform specifically for them.

171
00:07:23,814 --> 00:07:27,789
So that's one thing that I hope we'll be able to do.

172
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,493
I don't think, I'm not sure if we'll be able

173
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:32,365
to do that in 2024, but maybe in the near

174
00:07:32,366 --> 00:07:35,565
future we should be able to work towards that.

175
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:37,101
I'm not sure how my schedule will be.

176
00:07:37,102 --> 00:07:39,625
Like, you have a lot of work already.

177
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,749
Yeah, it's cross platform and also multiple languages.

178
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,085
It's like, wow, yeah.

179
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:52,045
And is this something that, you know,

180
00:07:52,046 --> 00:07:55,277
the PyLadies community or the Django community

181
00:07:55,278 --> 00:07:58,997
can help create PRs or can people

182
00:07:58,998 --> 00:08:00,273
Contribute to it? Or?

183
00:08:00,274 --> 00:08:02,917
Yes, it will be great.

184
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:08,253
I think what happened with Django Girls is the burnouts

185
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,253
did not affect the founders only, but I think most

186
00:08:11,254 --> 00:08:15,473
of the contributors who worked with the founders when it

187
00:08:15,474 --> 00:08:19,185
started in 2014, they also went through the burnout.

188
00:08:19,186 --> 00:08:22,873
So we have fewer contributors now than

189
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:25,285
Django Girls yet, like back in 2017.

190
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:28,321
So we are always open to new contributors

191
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:30,833
coming up to work on the tutorial, work

192
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:33,633
on the website and all our other resources.

193
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:37,009
And if PyLadies, if you, they can work with us on that.

194
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,390
Will definitely welcome them as

195
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:40,967
well as the Django community.

196
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:44,755
Every now and then, at sprints at DjangoCon Europe.

197
00:08:45,495 --> 00:08:49,399
I do attend them and I get people who contribute.

198
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,655
I have some regulars who contribute

199
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,831
only at DjangoCon Europe.

200
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,103
I think that will help if we add more people

201
00:08:55,104 --> 00:08:58,471
from the Django community and PyLadies contributing to the

202
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:01,583
resources because I know many people use the Django Girls

203
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:05,815
tutorial to introduce people to Python and Django.

204
00:09:05,816 --> 00:09:09,575
It's just that we have fewer maintainers these days.

205
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:11,699
Yeah, I think that's really good.

206
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,651
So maybe we can have a

207
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,259
sprint for the Django Girls tutorial.

208
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,275
Yeah, yeah, that'll be great.

209
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:17,875
Yeah.

210
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:20,667
Can you let us maybe can you share with us?

211
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:23,123
Like, how can people get started

212
00:09:23,124 --> 00:09:25,219
to contribute to this project?

213
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,675
And do you have links or what's the best way?

214
00:09:28,676 --> 00:09:30,627
All right, so for each of our

215
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:34,375
resources we have a Contributing Guide.

216
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:36,091
Oh, that's good.

217
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:37,251
On GitHub. Yeah.

218
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:38,345
So if you.

219
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:39,513
If you want to contribute to the

220
00:09:39,514 --> 00:09:42,873
tutorial, there's an how to contribute guide,

221
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,257
contributing guide there.

222
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:47,025
If it's the organizer manual, it's also.

223
00:09:47,026 --> 00:09:49,537
We also have that as well as the website.

224
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:52,401
So you can just go on GitHub, fork our

225
00:09:52,402 --> 00:09:55,585
repo, whichever one you want to contribute to.

226
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:58,121
You read the contributing guide on how to set up

227
00:09:58,122 --> 00:10:01,217
on your local machine and then you can also check

228
00:10:01,218 --> 00:10:04,243
the issues that are already there on the repo or

229
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:07,259
if you find any issues like typos, especially in the

230
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,291
cases of the tutorial and our organizer manual, coach manual.

231
00:10:11,292 --> 00:10:14,995
You are welcome to suggest pull requests for them.

232
00:10:14,996 --> 00:10:15,843
Yeah.

233
00:10:15,844 --> 00:10:18,291
So maybe after that we will collect the link from

234
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:20,867
you and then we'll add it in the episode.

235
00:10:20,868 --> 00:10:24,035
Yeah, I can compile all the links for on how

236
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:27,019
to contribute to our resources and give them to you.

237
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,815
Yay. Thank you.

238
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:30,587
Thank you.

239
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:34,411
So, yeah, you're doing so much for Django Girls.

240
00:10:34,412 --> 00:10:37,107
I know Django Girls is, like you said, it may be

241
00:10:37,108 --> 00:10:39,563
the first step for a lot of people to discover Python.

242
00:10:39,564 --> 00:10:42,243
So is it how you discover Python and Django?

243
00:10:42,244 --> 00:10:44,535
When and how do you discover them?

244
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:51,175
Oh, so up until 2015 I had no idea there's Python.

245
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:53,811
Okay.

246
00:10:53,812 --> 00:10:57,009
So I met a friend of mine who was learning,

247
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:01,425
I think he was doing Android through digital, a digital

248
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:05,097
skills program offered by Muzinda Hub in Harare.

249
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,481
And then he encouraged.

250
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:09,553
We worked together at one of my previous

251
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:11,833
employers and he encouraged me to apply.

252
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:15,745
So I applied and I chose Python because

253
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:18,233
I thought I was interested in data science.

254
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:20,289
I still am, but I think I

255
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,221
like the software development side more.

256
00:11:23,222 --> 00:11:27,845
So I chose Python because it's general purpose,

257
00:11:27,846 --> 00:11:30,469
you can use it for many other uses.

258
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:35,549
And that was, I think I started around March 2015.

259
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,493
So we're learning through Treehouse and

260
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:40,301
back then Kenneth Love was still working

261
00:11:40,302 --> 00:11:42,065
at Treehouse, so he was my teacher.

262
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:43,621
Yeah, yeah.

263
00:11:43,622 --> 00:11:45,805
But it was online and remote.

264
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:49,461
After, after doing Python, I did Flask, which

265
00:11:49,462 --> 00:11:51,877
I used for my first project is.

266
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:55,201
Which was a portal of some sort.

267
00:11:55,202 --> 00:11:56,921
And then a friend of mine,

268
00:11:56,922 --> 00:11:59,873
Humphrey, introduced me to Django.

269
00:11:59,874 --> 00:12:02,353
We wanted to organize a Django Girls event

270
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:06,353
in Harare for 2016 and we wanted also

271
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:08,881
to organize a PyCon in Zimbabwe in 2016.

272
00:12:08,882 --> 00:12:11,049
So for me to learn Django, I used the

273
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,337
Django Girls tutorial and the Django tutorial themselves together.

274
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:19,113
And then, yeah, that's how I got started with Django.

275
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,891
Yeah, that's really cool.

276
00:12:20,892 --> 00:12:24,003
So, yeah, and I, I love hearing that.

277
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:27,531
I, I feel like 2015 isn't that long ago.

278
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:30,771
It maybe long to people, like, it feels quite

279
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:33,059
recent to me, you know, and you're just learning

280
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,651
and already you're contributing back to the community.

281
00:12:36,652 --> 00:12:40,491
You're leading the Django Girls, you know, being in

282
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:42,899
part of, you know, being involved in the DSF,

283
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,265
I think that's really, it's really inspiring.

284
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,525
So thank you for all the work you do.

285
00:12:49,265 --> 00:12:50,369
Thank you.

286
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,057
Actually, yeah, you're right.

287
00:12:52,058 --> 00:12:54,945
I think I, I started contributing to

288
00:12:54,946 --> 00:12:58,009
Python and Django when I was actually

289
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,265
a beginner, mainly because there wasn't much.

290
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:04,265
Python wasn't very known in Zimbabwe back then and

291
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:07,017
there were no opportunities for us in Zimbabwe.

292
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:07,649
So it was.

293
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:11,337
We thought it best for the community to get together,

294
00:13:11,338 --> 00:13:15,225
organize events and somewhere it led me to the DSF

295
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:17,257
and then I ended up being on the board

296
00:13:17,258 --> 00:13:20,741
for five years as Director, Vice President

297
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:23,165
for two, and President for two years.

298
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,077
And I remember my first event was

299
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:27,037
Django Under the Hood in 2016.

300
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:29,893
I went under the Django Girls umbrella as well.

301
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:32,573
And like I felt like I am a beginner.

302
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:34,429
I couldn't understand like most of

303
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,865
the things they were talking about.

304
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:40,293
I couldn't understand things that are going on at Django

305
00:13:40,294 --> 00:13:44,933
codes because I joined the community as a beginner and

306
00:13:44,934 --> 00:13:48,069
became a leader before I had actually honed up my

307
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,497
skills, you know, in Python, in Django.

308
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,417
But it has also helped me to grow because

309
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:58,185
you let you meet people, you learn from them.

310
00:13:58,186 --> 00:14:00,553
Sometimes it doesn't make sense then, but when you go

311
00:14:00,554 --> 00:14:03,761
back you can go on and reflect and learn and

312
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:05,665
understand the concept that they were talking about.

313
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:09,165
I think I got involved with the community too early.

314
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,425
Is there something for you, like happen in your first

315
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:18,475
Django Girl that makes you feel like this is.

316
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:19,523
Feel like home to me.

317
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:21,819
I want to, you know, work more on

318
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,763
this project or like this, you know, initiative.

319
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:28,283
And so my first Django Girls event, I was

320
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:32,371
a coach at Django Girls Windhoek in Namibia.

321
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,971
It was part of PyCon Namibia 2016.

322
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:37,043
We, Daniele is always talking about this.

323
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:40,491
We traveled like 33 hours by road

324
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:42,667
to get there because the grant couldn't

325
00:14:42,668 --> 00:14:46,071
cover flights for us, Humphrey and I. So.

326
00:14:46,072 --> 00:14:47,215
But it was nice.

327
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:50,431
There were high school students, there were university students

328
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,959
and then they were more like there were other

329
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,023
women who were like almost my age or younger.

330
00:14:57,024 --> 00:14:58,439
Then there were mature women who

331
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,487
were like older than me almost.

332
00:15:00,488 --> 00:15:03,395
Almost like the same age as my mother, you know.

333
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:04,863
Yeah.

334
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:07,231
Who were learning Python and Django

335
00:15:07,232 --> 00:15:10,583
through a Django Girls workshop.

336
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:14,223
I've worked at a university for women before.

337
00:15:14,224 --> 00:15:16,539
When I was starting, I think I like, like

338
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,435
I like it when we create environment for women

339
00:15:20,436 --> 00:15:24,155
which is welcoming, where they can learn without being

340
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,747
judged, you know, without being told, you know, it's

341
00:15:26,748 --> 00:15:30,067
easy, you know, why can't you get this fast,

342
00:15:30,068 --> 00:15:32,371
quicker and you know, learning at their own pace?

343
00:15:32,372 --> 00:15:35,291
So I think after attending Django Girls Windhoek as well

344
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:38,283
as organizing Django Girls Harare for our Django Girls Harare,

345
00:15:38,284 --> 00:15:41,035
which was my second event, we had like primary school

346
00:15:41,036 --> 00:15:45,299
kids who were aged nine, they were youngest participants and

347
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,733
then we had women in their 40s, 50s and then

348
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:52,517
we had like the middle aged women.

349
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,205
So yeah, I think because those were like

350
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:58,661
my first events, I saw what Django Girls

351
00:15:58,662 --> 00:16:01,305
was doing to women and girls.

352
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:05,549
And when I went to, when I then went to

353
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:09,925
Django Under the Hood in 2016, November, I already like

354
00:16:09,926 --> 00:16:13,237
organized two Django Girls events are in Harare and Mashingui

355
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:16,973
and also attended Django Girls Windhoek in Namibia.

356
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:19,781
Then I thought we have the problem

357
00:16:19,782 --> 00:16:22,285
of women being underrepresented in tech was

358
00:16:22,286 --> 00:16:24,477
something that was peculiar to Africa.

359
00:16:24,478 --> 00:16:27,453
In my girls, in my class when we're doing in high

360
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:30,381
school I did math, physics and computing for A level and

361
00:16:30,382 --> 00:16:33,165
we two girls in our physics class out of 20.

362
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:36,245
So we're like 10% and for my degree we started

363
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:40,701
like we about 110 and we were about 10 or

364
00:16:40,702 --> 00:16:44,061
11 women by the time we graduated we were around

365
00:16:44,062 --> 00:16:47,521
45 to 50 and we were six women.

366
00:16:47,522 --> 00:16:50,345
So I had grown, you know, used to being 10

367
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:53,113
of yeah the population because you are in STEM.

368
00:16:53,114 --> 00:16:56,049
So when I went to Django Under the Hood, I was surprised

369
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,625
when I walked into the room for the first time and I

370
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:02,905
was like, oh, there are so many white men here.

371
00:17:02,906 --> 00:17:05,729
And I could count the women who were there at

372
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,145
the event, you know, so then that's when I realized,

373
00:17:08,146 --> 00:17:11,681
okay, so probably this is what Ola and Ola had

374
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:13,361
in mind when they started Django Girls.

375
00:17:13,362 --> 00:17:16,454
And that's when I realized what Django Girls,

376
00:17:16,455 --> 00:17:20,327
you know, means to the tech community globally.

377
00:17:20,328 --> 00:17:22,502
Not just for me as a Zimbabwean

378
00:17:22,503 --> 00:17:25,335
in Zimbabwe, but everywhere in the world.

379
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,782
We kind of have the same problems where we have

380
00:17:27,783 --> 00:17:31,375
fewer women in tech than compared to any other field.

381
00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:34,127
So I guess that's why I ended up working for them,

382
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:37,719
because the course makes sense to me even up to now.

383
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,623
I can relate to it.

384
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:43,255
Yeah, I totally understand because I also study physics and

385
00:17:43,256 --> 00:17:47,707
my class also only 10%, and like, half of the

386
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,771
women who studying physics actually don't want to be there.

387
00:17:50,772 --> 00:17:53,051
So it's very tough.

388
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:56,579
And I wish when I was younger, I have the same insight.

389
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,307
I was like, oh, maybe we should

390
00:17:58,308 --> 00:18:00,155
create a space like Django girls.

391
00:18:00,156 --> 00:18:02,455
But, well, now we're here.

392
00:18:03,155 --> 00:18:03,975
Yeah.

393
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:07,099
Yeah, I think it's really important.

394
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,655
And I mean, even now, it's still.

395
00:18:10,185 --> 00:18:12,865
Representation of women is still an issue in the.

396
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:14,329
In our community, in the Python

397
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,241
and Django, in open source.

398
00:18:16,242 --> 00:18:17,953
Not quite there yet. So.

399
00:18:17,954 --> 00:18:20,121
Yeah, but we are trying.

400
00:18:20,122 --> 00:18:22,065
I know, like, there are people like you who are

401
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:25,377
trying, you know, and that's like, I think we need

402
00:18:25,378 --> 00:18:29,393
more people to actually realize that this is a problem.

403
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:32,761
And it's not because, you know, there's no women. Right.

404
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:35,233
It's not because women are not interested.

405
00:18:35,234 --> 00:18:36,833
We are trying. Like, we try.

406
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:39,657
But maybe there is something else that is,

407
00:18:39,658 --> 00:18:42,889
you know, the environment like you mentioned, like,

408
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,737
maybe women are being judged more and it's

409
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:48,257
just not a safe environment. So we.

410
00:18:48,258 --> 00:18:50,473
So I'm really glad to hear that there are

411
00:18:50,474 --> 00:18:53,185
initiatives like the Django Girls to make it.

412
00:18:53,186 --> 00:18:54,529
To make it more inclusive

413
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,985
and, you know, more welcoming.

414
00:18:55,986 --> 00:18:57,681
But you're taking on another challenge.

415
00:18:57,682 --> 00:19:01,841
You are now, like, studying overseas and, like,

416
00:19:01,842 --> 00:19:04,147
you know, how does it feel for you?

417
00:19:04,148 --> 00:19:05,763
You're in a new place.

418
00:19:05,764 --> 00:19:08,235
And maybe also, like in the class, there isn't

419
00:19:08,236 --> 00:19:09,987
a lot of people who are like you.

420
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:14,779
So, yeah, I think, honestly, I. I.

421
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,815
Feel so old now because.

422
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:20,095
No, never say that.

423
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,295
2009.

424
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:26,451
So it has taken me 15 years to pursue

425
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:29,069
a master's in software engineering, which is something that

426
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,485
I've wanted to do for a very long time.

427
00:19:31,486 --> 00:19:34,325
I'm excited, but I'm also.

428
00:19:34,326 --> 00:19:36,213
I'm looking forward to it.

429
00:19:36,214 --> 00:19:39,069
I am hoping that I can manage the

430
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,701
pressure of being back in school again after,

431
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:45,045
you know, many years of taking a break.

432
00:19:45,046 --> 00:19:48,349
I've done some courses in between, but full

433
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,341
time education, this is the first time that

434
00:19:50,342 --> 00:19:53,021
I'm doing full time education after graduating.

435
00:19:53,022 --> 00:19:55,093
So I'm looking forward to it.

436
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:56,253
It's a new challenge.

437
00:19:56,254 --> 00:19:59,101
I'm waiting to see what it's going to look

438
00:19:59,102 --> 00:20:02,033
like next week when I start because here they.

439
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,441
The way the courses are structured is different

440
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:06,921
from what I am used to in Zimbabwe.

441
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:10,193
You have a set timetable in back in Zimbabwe where

442
00:20:10,194 --> 00:20:13,833
you know, I have these courses here and then like

443
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:17,001
your day, you know, your how your

444
00:20:17,002 --> 00:20:19,433
timetable is going to look like for the whole semester.

445
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:23,025
But now here they do like you do two courses at a time.

446
00:20:23,026 --> 00:20:23,801
Okay.

447
00:20:23,802 --> 00:20:25,337
Yeah, out of four.

448
00:20:25,338 --> 00:20:28,161
So I have the schedule for the first two courses.

449
00:20:28,162 --> 00:20:30,949
Then we, we write exams.

450
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,885
We do the other two courses.

451
00:20:32,886 --> 00:20:33,965
Okay.

452
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,429
Beginning in the middle.

453
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:35,957
Yeah.

454
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:39,589
Then you as you, you kind of like you

455
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,773
have few hours of lectures but they say it's.

456
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,669
You have to do a 40 hour week when

457
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,357
you left like maybe at most probably you have

458
00:20:47,358 --> 00:20:50,989
like six hours, maybe 12 hours of lectures.

459
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,437
But you're supposed to be 40 hour weeks.

460
00:20:52,438 --> 00:20:55,023
So the other study is supposed

461
00:20:55,024 --> 00:20:56,911
to be either in group work.

462
00:20:56,912 --> 00:20:58,703
They do a lot of group work here.

463
00:20:58,704 --> 00:21:01,447
I haven't met my classmates so I don't know what's my.

464
00:21:01,448 --> 00:21:03,407
All my group is still going to look like.

465
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:07,991
But you also have to like pace yourself, be organized and be

466
00:21:07,992 --> 00:21:11,711
able to study on your own to make those 40 hours.

467
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:16,047
So yeah, it's going to be a new challenge.

468
00:21:16,048 --> 00:21:18,399
Yeah. Yeah.

469
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,135
That's a very like brave like you know, kind of

470
00:21:22,136 --> 00:21:25,461
jump because I know like for women, like a lot

471
00:21:25,462 --> 00:21:27,829
of women, luckily I don't have that problem.

472
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,269
But like maybe some women, oh, they kind of take a

473
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,429
break from their career, you know, take care of the family

474
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,893
and like you know, have to start something again like back

475
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:38,825
in tech or like it's, it's a huge challenge. Yeah.

476
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:40,645
Yeah. For me. Okay.

477
00:21:40,646 --> 00:21:43,725
So for me it's taking a break. Okay.

478
00:21:43,726 --> 00:21:45,045
To go back to school.

479
00:21:45,046 --> 00:21:47,109
But I'm still single so I

480
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,437
don't have a family to consider.

481
00:21:48,438 --> 00:21:49,989
I think that makes it easy.

482
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:54,323
It's just a matter of holding up my residency, the

483
00:21:54,324 --> 00:21:57,955
apartment that I was living in Harare and coming here

484
00:21:57,956 --> 00:22:00,755
and set up another apartment for two years.

485
00:22:00,756 --> 00:22:03,995
And then we see how that goes after two years.

486
00:22:03,996 --> 00:22:06,979
But yeah, it was, I.

487
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:11,251
Maybe it's because the application process for to study in

488
00:22:11,252 --> 00:22:14,571
Sweden, it takes a bit of some time because I

489
00:22:14,572 --> 00:22:17,715
started looking at the programs in October last year.

490
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:20,371
I was hoping to get a scholarship

491
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,375
with the Swedish Institute, which I did.

492
00:22:22,955 --> 00:22:26,031
And they opened the announcement, the programs

493
00:22:26,032 --> 00:22:28,151
that they were going to fund in

494
00:22:28,152 --> 00:22:29,943
the 15th of the 15th of November.

495
00:22:29,944 --> 00:22:32,423
So I now knew which programs that I wanted to apply to.

496
00:22:32,424 --> 00:22:34,799
And then the application closed in the

497
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,711
15th of January, and then deadline for

498
00:22:38,712 --> 00:22:40,711
payment of application fees was one February.

499
00:22:40,712 --> 00:22:42,879
And then they opened the scholarship the 12th

500
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,359
of February and closed the 28th of February.

501
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,927
So I had to wait for the admission

502
00:22:48,928 --> 00:22:50,791
for the 21st of March and then wait

503
00:22:50,792 --> 00:22:53,327
for the scholarship announcement the 25th of April.

504
00:22:53,328 --> 00:22:54,605
So I guess with.

505
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:58,325
Through all that waiting and as well as

506
00:22:58,326 --> 00:23:01,221
then after knowing and then doing the application

507
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:04,053
for the residence permit and you kind of

508
00:23:04,054 --> 00:23:06,445
have time to prepare yourself mentally.

509
00:23:06,446 --> 00:23:09,069
Am I going to leave the country now?

510
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,093
Am I going to fold things? Yeah.

511
00:23:11,094 --> 00:23:13,453
By the time that you have to leave in August. Yeah.

512
00:23:13,454 --> 00:23:19,805
You kind of have like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

513
00:23:19,806 --> 00:23:20,701
You know. Yeah.

514
00:23:20,702 --> 00:23:22,973
You are mentally prepared to say, okay, I'm now

515
00:23:22,974 --> 00:23:25,827
living this and I'm starting a new chapter.

516
00:23:25,828 --> 00:23:27,395
We'll see how it goes.

517
00:23:27,396 --> 00:23:27,787
Yeah.

518
00:23:27,788 --> 00:23:29,255
I'm afraid of the cold.

519
00:23:33,115 --> 00:23:34,175
In the winter.

520
00:23:35,995 --> 00:23:38,135
So I don't know how it's going to look like.

521
00:23:39,235 --> 00:23:39,979
I've been.

522
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,155
I have been to the west and I think

523
00:23:42,156 --> 00:23:47,715
November in 2016 in Amsterdam, but it was in.

524
00:23:47,716 --> 00:23:50,611
It was cold, but it wasn't that cold.

525
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:55,067
It's very cold in February, in January and February.

526
00:23:55,068 --> 00:23:59,551
And then I was in Prague for Ubuntu Summit in.

527
00:23:59,552 --> 00:24:00,543
In November as well.

528
00:24:00,544 --> 00:24:01,975
Early November.

529
00:24:01,976 --> 00:24:03,511
Yeah, both times were early November,

530
00:24:03,512 --> 00:24:05,575
so it wasn't that cold.

531
00:24:05,576 --> 00:24:08,335
So I have no idea.

532
00:24:08,336 --> 00:24:10,615
And I remember when I was.

533
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:11,983
When I was coming for. Yeah.

534
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:15,535
To DjangoCon Europe in June, I left Zimbabwe.

535
00:24:15,536 --> 00:24:16,715
It was very warm.

536
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:19,087
Then when I got to South Africa,

537
00:24:19,088 --> 00:24:21,415
it was like 14 degrees Celsius.

538
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:23,081
And like when we getting off the

539
00:24:23,082 --> 00:24:27,145
plane, it was windy and cold.

540
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:29,521
And I'm like, okay, this is.

541
00:24:29,522 --> 00:24:30,993
This is at a time that I'm thinking

542
00:24:30,994 --> 00:24:33,977
of leaving Zimbabwe, which is like 300 days

543
00:24:33,978 --> 00:24:37,321
of sun and warm, to relocate to Sweden.

544
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:39,369
And I'm struggling with 14 degrees

545
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,241
Celsius, something they call summer in.

546
00:24:43,242 --> 00:24:44,585
In the West.

547
00:24:44,586 --> 00:24:45,845
Yeah, yeah.

548
00:24:47,225 --> 00:24:48,481
Because your summer.

549
00:24:48,482 --> 00:24:50,001
Because the summer here is as good

550
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:52,217
as my winter in Zimbabwe, you know?

551
00:24:52,218 --> 00:24:53,805
So I was like, if I really.

552
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:58,289
Another thing that I have, like, still not getting

553
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,897
used to maybe, probably because I live in London,

554
00:25:00,898 --> 00:25:03,801
is that the snow and the slipperiness of the

555
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:06,081
floor, because we don't snow a lot in London.

556
00:25:06,082 --> 00:25:09,433
Only once every few years but like every

557
00:25:09,434 --> 00:25:11,857
time I remember I've been to Sweden twice.

558
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:13,225
Both of them are in the winter.

559
00:25:13,226 --> 00:25:18,345
It's very cold and slippery like you have to buy

560
00:25:18,346 --> 00:25:21,225
those special things to put on your boots so you

561
00:25:21,226 --> 00:25:25,441
don't sleep and yeah, yeah, I haven't, I.

562
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:27,097
Haven't taken care of the boots thing

563
00:25:27,098 --> 00:25:28,761
but I hope to get to it.

564
00:25:28,762 --> 00:25:31,569
Yeah but people there will teach you.

565
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:34,449
And yeah, yeah, even started

566
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,089
regretting living Zimbabwe age.

567
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,217
But yeah, in terms of the weather, I

568
00:25:38,218 --> 00:25:40,833
just been home so far not as cold.

569
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:43,449
So yeah, we'll see how the window goes.

570
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,265
Right.

571
00:25:44,266 --> 00:25:46,025
What do you think is the role

572
00:25:46,026 --> 00:25:48,855
of younger girls for the community?

573
00:25:52,075 --> 00:25:55,739
Okay, so I think Django Girls is in

574
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,915
an important role in the community to close

575
00:26:00,916 --> 00:26:05,107
the gender gap for within the tech industry.

576
00:26:05,108 --> 00:26:08,203
We have so many men compared to women and what

577
00:26:08,204 --> 00:26:11,651
we are doing is we are providing free resources for

578
00:26:11,652 --> 00:26:15,603
women to organize workshops that introduce women to programming.

579
00:26:15,604 --> 00:26:19,467
With Python and Django we have done two surveys software

580
00:26:19,468 --> 00:26:25,911
one in 2017, 2018 and another one recently which we

581
00:26:25,912 --> 00:26:29,191
haven't published the results for and but what we have

582
00:26:29,192 --> 00:26:33,023
found is some of our attendees quite a good percentage

583
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:36,191
I can remember I think about was it 21% last

584
00:26:36,192 --> 00:26:41,015
time it actually transitioned from their careers to working to

585
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,359
take in different roles.

586
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,311
Obviously after attending our workshop is still it won't be

587
00:26:47,312 --> 00:26:50,127
enough for someone but mostly go on to learn.

588
00:26:50,128 --> 00:26:52,899
You know about 7, 75% they continue learning

589
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,003
with learning Python, learning programming until they actually

590
00:26:56,004 --> 00:26:59,195
transition to working to take in different roles.

591
00:26:59,196 --> 00:27:01,595
So while it takes time for us to have

592
00:27:01,596 --> 00:27:05,163
results, I think we as a community doing an

593
00:27:05,164 --> 00:27:09,435
important role in introducing women to programming and having

594
00:27:09,436 --> 00:27:12,215
more people women involved in tech.

595
00:27:12,835 --> 00:27:16,883
So how I'm curious, how can the community

596
00:27:16,884 --> 00:27:20,127
support, you know, the Django Girls Foundation?

597
00:27:20,128 --> 00:27:24,375
I know your fundraising like is there active fundraising

598
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:28,679
that people can support right now or what other

599
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,455
ways can we support the Django Girls community?

600
00:27:32,456 --> 00:27:33,663
Okay, so we are always

601
00:27:33,664 --> 00:27:37,335
fundraising all throughout the year.

602
00:27:37,336 --> 00:27:39,447
We welcome donations anytime.

603
00:27:39,448 --> 00:27:42,847
People can reach out to me via LinkedIn or using

604
00:27:42,848 --> 00:27:47,105
the Django Girls website and I can give them details

605
00:27:47,106 --> 00:27:50,225
on how they can donate to Django Girls.

606
00:27:50,226 --> 00:27:55,305
Also we always look for companies that can have their

607
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:57,609
employees donate their time to work on our resources.

608
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,441
That's something that we welcome as

609
00:27:59,442 --> 00:28:02,065
well and we're always looking for.

610
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:04,001
We are hoping to have new content

611
00:28:04,002 --> 00:28:05,961
and we have some projects underway.

612
00:28:05,962 --> 00:28:07,057
New projects underway.

613
00:28:07,058 --> 00:28:08,985
And that would be helpful if we

614
00:28:08,986 --> 00:28:11,401
had partners to work with us.

615
00:28:11,402 --> 00:28:14,201
We went to do a crowdfunding campaign but I

616
00:28:14,202 --> 00:28:17,397
was a bit away because of the relocation and

617
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:19,693
our OSM Ambassadors was also on holiday.

618
00:28:19,694 --> 00:28:21,637
We're not sure if, I'm not sure if we'll

619
00:28:21,638 --> 00:28:23,669
continue with that this year or it might be

620
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:27,389
for next year but we always welcome donations anytime.

621
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,909
Yeah, we do have a Patreon page

622
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,533
that they can contribute to also.

623
00:28:31,534 --> 00:28:33,053
They can sign up for monthly

624
00:28:33,054 --> 00:28:35,421
donations through our Patreon page.

625
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,749
I can share the link as well?

626
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,365
Yes, please. Yeah.

627
00:28:38,366 --> 00:28:40,421
If they want to be ongoing

628
00:28:40,422 --> 00:28:42,893
supporters, contribute monthly with that.

629
00:28:42,894 --> 00:28:46,077
We are also on GitHub sponsors, companies and individuals alike

630
00:28:46,078 --> 00:28:48,085
can also sign up to support us through the.

631
00:28:48,086 --> 00:28:50,731
And then we have PayPal and Stripe.

632
00:28:50,732 --> 00:28:52,163
People want to donate through that.

633
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:54,923
We have set up various channels for people to donate.

634
00:28:54,924 --> 00:28:59,275
I think Django Girl is a very good like initiative.

635
00:28:59,276 --> 00:29:02,875
I think companies like, you know, they are maybe sponsoring

636
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:04,931
events and stuff but I think, you know, if you

637
00:29:04,932 --> 00:29:08,931
want to target, you know, certain group of people in

638
00:29:08,932 --> 00:29:12,987
a community, I think maybe consider Django Girls. Yeah.

639
00:29:12,988 --> 00:29:13,667
Yes.

640
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,371
I hope we have more companies come to support us.

641
00:29:16,372 --> 00:29:18,515
We've had some companies that supported us for

642
00:29:18,516 --> 00:29:20,767
quite a number of years but I think

643
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,535
Covid sort of like upset everything and it

644
00:29:23,536 --> 00:29:25,911
also did affect our sponsorship as well.

645
00:29:25,912 --> 00:29:27,735
So we are hoping to get new sponsors

646
00:29:27,736 --> 00:29:30,255
to continue to support our week as well.

647
00:29:30,256 --> 00:29:30,935
Yeah.

648
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:34,423
So yeah, you have talked about a lot of things.

649
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:36,823
So any plans except you know, you're

650
00:29:36,824 --> 00:29:38,687
setting up the crowd funding and stuff

651
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,679
but like anything for Django Girls.

652
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,415
Anything for yourself. Yeah.

653
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:44,047
Okay.

654
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:50,313
For myself I want to complete my Masters so I

655
00:29:50,314 --> 00:29:54,045
hope to do that as do do that very well.

656
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:58,489
We have a three week roll call to see how you're doing.

657
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,185
So I hope by then I'll be doing

658
00:30:01,186 --> 00:30:04,737
fine so that I, I keep my scholarship.

659
00:30:04,738 --> 00:30:08,993
I think by now I know I want to work in

660
00:30:08,994 --> 00:30:13,665
open source after I graduate and there's a role that I'm

661
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:18,077
aiming for that I keep checking whether they've hired, hired, hired.

662
00:30:18,078 --> 00:30:21,981
So that's something that I'm targeting to get after

663
00:30:21,982 --> 00:30:24,485
I complete my studies in the next two years.

664
00:30:24,486 --> 00:30:28,149
And then for Django Girls we, we have a plan to

665
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:32,685
start a boot camp but it isn't quite rolled out yet.

666
00:30:32,686 --> 00:30:36,749
It will start in the UK so I'm hoping that we

667
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:42,461
will be able to introduce that maybe 25, 2025 or 2026.

668
00:30:42,462 --> 00:30:46,397
Instead of just giving women a one day workshop, we provide

669
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:50,485
resources for them to learn for a number of weeks and

670
00:30:50,486 --> 00:30:53,701
also we are aiming for it to be flexible to cater

671
00:30:53,702 --> 00:30:58,069
for women who have child care issues, you know. Yeah.

672
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,349
So that they can be able to participate in

673
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,989
their own pace and hopefully that will lead also

674
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:06,885
to mentorship and for them to get new roles.

675
00:31:06,886 --> 00:31:08,547
So that's the one thing that

676
00:31:08,548 --> 00:31:10,771
we have been hinting about.

677
00:31:10,772 --> 00:31:13,187
Plans are just not set yet.

678
00:31:13,188 --> 00:31:15,331
But yeah, that's something that we hope

679
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:18,747
to work towards in the coming years.

680
00:31:18,748 --> 00:31:20,867
Yeah, that sounds interesting.

681
00:31:20,868 --> 00:31:24,171
Yeah, I think that will be useful to have, like

682
00:31:24,172 --> 00:31:26,707
you said, more than just, you know, one day workshop

683
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:30,163
and have a series of, you know, ongoing training.

684
00:31:30,164 --> 00:31:31,739
I think that's very exciting.

685
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,891
I'm looking forward to learn more

686
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:35,839
about and hopefully we can help. We can help.

687
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,839
Especially I'm in the uk, I'm having help.

688
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,783
Yeah, that's really good and it's very good to

689
00:31:42,784 --> 00:31:45,463
hear and thank you for sharing so many stories

690
00:31:45,464 --> 00:31:49,855
with us and yeah, I think it's a very

691
00:31:49,856 --> 00:31:52,383
enjoyable chat with you and know about.

692
00:31:52,384 --> 00:31:54,359
Know more about Django Girls is, you

693
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,799
know, I always heard about the name.

694
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,247
I try to help out once in a while.

695
00:31:58,248 --> 00:31:59,823
Not a lot, but then like now

696
00:31:59,824 --> 00:32:01,703
I understand like more like, you know

697
00:32:01,704 --> 00:32:04,295
about Django Girls and also interesting story.

698
00:32:04,296 --> 00:32:07,019
Moving so far, far away to somewhere so cold

699
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,015
and you have to build your own furniture.

700
00:32:11,995 --> 00:32:12,507
Yeah.

701
00:32:12,508 --> 00:32:15,923
So thank you so much and thank you, Anna.

702
00:32:15,924 --> 00:32:17,635
Thank you, thank you for having me.
