1
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,881
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:21,882 --> 00:00:24,609
New PyPodcats again here today.

3
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,331
We have, we are so excited because we have Anna

4
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:30,795
from the Django Girls Foundation to be with us.

5
00:00:30,796 --> 00:00:35,451
And so you have already seen Mariatta and I'm Cheuk

6
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,907
and we are the host of the PyPodcats.

7
00:00:37,908 --> 00:00:40,243
So for Anna, I think it's the best if you

8
00:00:40,244 --> 00:00:42,979
can introduce yourself because we really want to know about

9
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,131
you and I don't want to miss anything.

10
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:45,939
Hi, Cheuk.

11
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,099
Hi, Mariatta.

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,043
I'm so excited to be here.

13
00:00:49,044 --> 00:00:50,187
Thank you for having me.

14
00:00:50,188 --> 00:00:53,003
So my name is Anna Makarudze.

15
00:00:53,004 --> 00:00:56,459
I'm the current Django Girls Fundraising Coordinator, a

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,287
position that I've held since June 2016, 2017.

17
00:00:59,288 --> 00:01:02,271
And I'm also a trustee for the Board

18
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:05,431
of trustees for Django Girls Foundation and also

19
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,471
Software Engineer for Django Girls foundation since August

20
00:01:08,472 --> 00:01:11,399
2020 when there was a transition in leadership.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,743
I also support the Django Girls website and

22
00:01:14,744 --> 00:01:17,823
the other resources in the GitHub repo.

23
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,943
So I'm kind of like the lead maintainer for the

24
00:01:20,944 --> 00:01:25,399
website and also work with volunteers to maintain our resources

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,663
because the website and the tutorial in our coaches manual,

26
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:32,051
organizer manual, they are all open source.

27
00:01:32,052 --> 00:01:34,651
So we work with volunteers to maintain them,

28
00:01:34,652 --> 00:01:36,419
to make sure that they are kept up

29
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,735
to date and accessible to the general public.

30
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:44,451
Yeah, I have heard some so much like exciting

31
00:01:44,452 --> 00:01:47,019
news from Django Girls like earlier this year.

32
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,555
So I know now we are Django Girls Plus (+).

33
00:01:50,556 --> 00:01:51,855
Yes. Yes.

34
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:57,055
It was addition that the board of trustees made

35
00:01:57,056 --> 00:01:59,791
because over the years we're being asked if we

36
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:03,839
were inclusive of trans women and LGBQT.

37
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,663
So it was just easier to add a "plus"

38
00:02:06,664 --> 00:02:10,447
to our name without really changing our the known

39
00:02:10,448 --> 00:02:12,015
name that we've had for 10 years.

40
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:13,775
As you know, we're turned 10 year this year.

41
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:15,903
So yeah, it was a win for us.

42
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:18,935
So we, over the years we've tried to change

43
00:02:18,936 --> 00:02:20,799
the language on our website to show that we

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,423
are inclusive of everyone who identifies as a woman.

45
00:02:23,424 --> 00:02:28,495
So that was the idea behind the name change.

46
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:30,343
Yeah, I'm so happy to see that.

47
00:02:30,344 --> 00:02:32,871
And you will be very busy and I know

48
00:02:32,872 --> 00:02:35,679
you also personally have to make a big change.

49
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,327
You're moving country.

50
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:39,375
Can you tell us a little bit about that?

51
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:43,079
So I've moved from Zimbabwe to

52
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,151
Sweden for my master's studies.

53
00:02:46,152 --> 00:02:49,287
I'll be studying software engineering at Blekinge

54
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:52,937
Institute of Technology in Karlskrona, Sweden. So.

55
00:02:52,938 --> 00:02:56,633
So I left Zimbabwe on the 14th of August and I'll

56
00:02:56,634 --> 00:03:00,955
be starting school on the on Monday the 2nd of September.

57
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:03,383
Are you excited?

58
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:04,839
Yes, I am.

59
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,835
So that's when we have our introduction day.

60
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:11,783
I get to learn more about the program, as well as

61
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:16,671
meet my classmates as well as my lecturers and professors.

62
00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:19,993
So, yeah, I'm excited for that and it's been

63
00:03:19,994 --> 00:03:22,641
a great change to what I'm used to.

64
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:23,489
Yeah.

65
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,205
Yeah.

66
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,209
Because when you.

67
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,841
In Zimbabwe, when you say, I want to

68
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:29,561
buy a bed, you buy a bed that

69
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:32,585
is complete, already assembled with a mattress.

70
00:03:32,586 --> 00:03:34,793
But I was shocked to find out. Yeah.

71
00:03:34,794 --> 00:03:36,249
You buy a bed separately and

72
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,833
then you buy a mattress separately.

73
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:38,241
Yeah.

74
00:03:38,242 --> 00:03:39,769
And the base comes in a box

75
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,045
and you have to, like, assemble everything.

76
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:44,841
So I had to buy a drill.

77
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:47,241
I now have a screwdriver, and I

78
00:03:47,242 --> 00:03:48,445
have a hammer.

79
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:50,885
Yeah the Swedish furniture

80
00:03:50,886 --> 00:03:52,461
We know, like, we don't have to mention the

81
00:03:52,462 --> 00:03:54,437
name, but if we see, let's say, like Swedish

82
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:57,145
furniture, we know you have to assemble it yourself.

83
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,865
That's how it works.

84
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:02,225
Yeah.

85
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:05,333
So, you know, a shock for me, I

86
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:06,901
I thought I ordered two pieces of

87
00:04:06,902 --> 00:04:08,905
furniture and I guess two boxes.

88
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:11,785
Oh, this is my bed. You sure?

89
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:15,949
But you are now very good with

90
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,785
hardware as well, so that's good.

91
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:21,141
Hardware and software, we can do everything.

92
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:21,380
Yeah.

93
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:22,641
It's really learning curve.

94
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:22,905
So.

95
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:23,217
Yeah.

96
00:04:23,218 --> 00:04:25,233
And it took me days. Yeah.

97
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:26,361
But I'm getting there now.

98
00:04:26,362 --> 00:04:28,625
So I am glad that I had time for this

99
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:30,649
because I came about two weeks earlier than when I

100
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,657
was supposed to start, so I had time to go

101
00:04:33,658 --> 00:04:36,697
through these new changes, you know, patiently.

102
00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:39,081
I didn't get frustrated because I wasn't in a rush.

103
00:04:39,082 --> 00:04:39,409
Yeah.

104
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,353
It would have been something else if I

105
00:04:41,354 --> 00:04:42,977
arrived just in the nick of time when

106
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:44,337
I was supposed to start my program.

107
00:04:44,338 --> 00:04:45,865
So, yeah, it has been a good

108
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:47,805
change, but I'm looking forward to it.

109
00:04:48,395 --> 00:04:49,595
Yeah, that's good.

110
00:04:49,596 --> 00:04:50,811
That's exciting.

111
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:52,895
Yeah, I'm glad for you.

112
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:54,563
Yeah.

113
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:55,895
Tell us more about.

114
00:04:56,635 --> 00:05:00,987
You mentioned you're doing software engineer lead for

115
00:05:00,988 --> 00:05:04,563
Django Girls, because I think that's really interesting.

116
00:05:04,564 --> 00:05:08,371
I know the Django Girls tutorials is one

117
00:05:08,372 --> 00:05:10,739
of the resources I like to share for

118
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,115
people who are learning Python, learning Django.

119
00:05:14,116 --> 00:05:16,251
So it's really useful resources.

120
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:17,995
Can you tell us more about

121
00:05:17,996 --> 00:05:20,099
this new role within Django Girls?

122
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,095
What do you do?

123
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:23,559
Okay, so the tutorial is a

124
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,687
bit separate from the website.

125
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:28,711
I normally work on the website, I'm maintaining

126
00:05:28,712 --> 00:05:32,775
it, making code changes, fixing bugs, and then

127
00:05:32,776 --> 00:05:35,815
I'm also in charge of deployment as well

128
00:05:35,816 --> 00:05:39,855
as adding new contributors to the website.

129
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:42,383
Then with the tutorial, every now and then, I

130
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:47,019
also contribute to it, like introducing new changes.

131
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,043
For some time, we're offering, we added a section where

132
00:05:50,044 --> 00:05:53,587
people could learn on the cloud using run code.

133
00:05:53,588 --> 00:05:55,571
They were giving us the platform for free.

134
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:57,035
But we have since removed it.

135
00:05:57,036 --> 00:05:58,483
Now because it's no longer

136
00:05:58,484 --> 00:05:59,955
available, people have to pay.

137
00:05:59,956 --> 00:06:02,419
So we try to make sure that

138
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,131
we have the things that we mentioned.

139
00:06:04,132 --> 00:06:05,299
The results that we mentioned in the

140
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,091
tutorial are free for the participants.

141
00:06:08,092 --> 00:06:10,691
So because it's no longer free, we remove that.

142
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:13,963
So every now and then, if they say, I

143
00:06:13,964 --> 00:06:18,091
wanted to restructure the tutorial actually, but it's huge.

144
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:23,255
So the first pull request that I did, it was a bit big.

145
00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:25,367
It took time to have people review it.

146
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:27,527
What we've been trying to do is to

147
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:29,479
shorten it by making sure that if you're

148
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,119
on Windows, you follow Windows instructions.

149
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,159
If you're on Linux, you follow Linux.

150
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,591
If you're on iOS, on Mac, you follow Mac instructions.

151
00:06:39,592 --> 00:06:42,391
But because everything is so mumbled up and it's a

152
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:45,429
long tutorial, it's difficult to do it in stages.

153
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,701
But at the same time, if you do

154
00:06:46,702 --> 00:06:48,685
a large pull request and it takes time

155
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:52,357
without being reviewed, it gets overtaken by events.

156
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:53,805
So now I'll.

157
00:06:53,806 --> 00:06:55,261
I think I'll have to start again.

158
00:06:55,262 --> 00:06:56,741
But that's something that we have

159
00:06:56,742 --> 00:06:58,645
wanted to do for some time.

160
00:06:58,646 --> 00:07:00,501
If I can get people to work with, we would

161
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:03,301
want to do that, to separate the instructions so that

162
00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:07,061
our participants are not confused by having to read through

163
00:07:07,062 --> 00:07:09,237
so many notes that really don't affect them.

164
00:07:09,238 --> 00:07:10,821
If you're on Windows, you don't need to know

165
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:13,911
about a note about Ubuntu or about MacOS

166
00:07:13,912 --> 00:07:16,677
And the same applies to those on Ubuntu and Mac.

167
00:07:16,678 --> 00:07:18,445
They don't need to know about Windows.

168
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:19,973
It would actually make it easier for

169
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:21,605
participants if they just get to go

170
00:07:21,606 --> 00:07:23,813
through what is platform specifically for them.

171
00:07:23,814 --> 00:07:27,789
So that's one thing that I hope we'll be able to do.

172
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,493
I don't think, I'm not sure if we'll be able

173
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:32,365
to do that in 2024, but maybe in the near

174
00:07:32,366 --> 00:07:35,565
future we should be able to work towards that.

175
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:37,101
I'm not sure how message will be.

176
00:07:37,102 --> 00:07:39,625
Like, you have a lot of work already.

177
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:46,749
Yeah, it's cross platform and also multiple languages.

178
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,085
It's like, wow, yeah.

179
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:52,045
And is this something that, you know,

180
00:07:52,046 --> 00:07:55,277
the PyLadies community or the Django community

181
00:07:55,278 --> 00:07:58,997
can help create PRs or can people

182
00:07:58,998 --> 00:08:00,820
contribute to it or?

183
00:08:00,821 --> 00:08:02,917
yes, it will be great.

184
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:08,253
I think what happened with Django Girls is the burnouts

185
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:11,253
did not affect the founders only, but I think most

186
00:08:11,254 --> 00:08:15,473
of the contributors who worked with the founders when it

187
00:08:15,474 --> 00:08:19,185
started in 2014, they also went through the burnout.

188
00:08:19,186 --> 00:08:22,873
So we have fewer contributors now than

189
00:08:22,874 --> 00:08:25,285
Django Girls yet, like back in 2017.

190
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:28,321
So we are always open to new contributors

191
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:30,833
coming up to work on the tutorial, work

192
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:33,633
on the website and all our other resources.

193
00:08:33,634 --> 00:08:37,009
And if PyLadies, if you, they can work with us on that.

194
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,390
Will definitely welcome them as

195
00:08:39,391 --> 00:08:40,967
well as the Django community.

196
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:44,755
Every now and then it sprints at DjangoCon Europe.

197
00:08:45,495 --> 00:08:49,399
I do attend them and I get people who contribute.

198
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,655
I have some regulars who contribute

199
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,831
only at DjangoCon Europe.

200
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:55,103
I think that will help if we add more people

201
00:08:55,104 --> 00:08:58,471
from the Django community and PyLadies contributing to the

202
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:01,583
resources because I know many people use the Django Girls

203
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:05,815
tutorial to introduce people to Python and Django.

204
00:09:05,816 --> 00:09:09,575
It's just that we have fewer maintainers these days.

205
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:11,699
Yeah, I think that's really good.

206
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,651
So maybe we can have a

207
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,259
sprint for the Django Girls tutorial.

208
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,275
Yeah, yeah, that'll be great.

209
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:17,875
Yeah.

210
00:09:17,876 --> 00:09:20,667
Can you let us maybe can you share with us?

211
00:09:20,668 --> 00:09:23,123
Like, how can people get started

212
00:09:23,124 --> 00:09:25,219
to contribute to this project?

213
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,675
And do you have links or what's the best way?

214
00:09:28,676 --> 00:09:30,627
All right, so for each of our

215
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:34,375
resources we have a contributing guide.

216
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:36,091
Oh, that's good.

217
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:37,251
On GitHub. Yeah.

218
00:09:37,252 --> 00:09:38,345
So if you.

219
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:39,513
If you want to contribute to the

220
00:09:39,514 --> 00:09:42,873
tutorial, they say how to contribute guide.

221
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,257
Contributing guide there.

222
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:47,025
If it's the organizer manual, it's also.

223
00:09:47,026 --> 00:09:49,537
We also have that as well as the website.

224
00:09:49,538 --> 00:09:52,401
So you can just go on GitHub, fork our

225
00:09:52,402 --> 00:09:55,585
repo, whichever one you want to contribute to.

226
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:58,121
You read the contributing guide on how to set up

227
00:09:58,122 --> 00:10:01,217
on your local machine and then you can also check

228
00:10:01,218 --> 00:10:04,243
the issues that are already there on the repo or

229
00:10:04,244 --> 00:10:07,259
if you find any issues like typos, especially in the

230
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,291
cases of the tutorial and our organizer manual, coach manual.

231
00:10:11,292 --> 00:10:14,995
You are welcome to suggest pull requests for them.

232
00:10:14,996 --> 00:10:15,843
Yeah.

233
00:10:15,844 --> 00:10:18,291
So maybe after that we will collect the link from

234
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:20,867
you and then we'll add it in the episode.

235
00:10:20,868 --> 00:10:24,035
Yeah, I can compile all the links for on how

236
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:27,019
to contribute to our resources and give them to you.

237
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,815
Yay. Thank you.

238
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:30,587
Thank you.

239
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:34,411
So, yeah, you're doing so much for Django Girls.

240
00:10:34,412 --> 00:10:37,107
I know Django Girls is, like you said, it may be

241
00:10:37,108 --> 00:10:39,563
the first step for a lot of people to discover Python.

242
00:10:39,564 --> 00:10:42,243
So is it how you discover Python and Django?

243
00:10:42,244 --> 00:10:44,535
When and how do you discover them?

244
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:51,175
Oh, so up until 2015 I had no idea there's Python.

245
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:53,811
Okay.

246
00:10:53,812 --> 00:10:57,009
So I met a friend of mine who was learning,

247
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:01,425
I think he was doing Android through digital, a digital

248
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:05,097
skills program offered by Muzinda Hub in Harare.

249
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,481
And then he encouraged.

250
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:09,553
We worked together at one of my previous

251
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:11,833
employers and he encouraged me to apply.

252
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:15,745
So I applied and I chose Python because

253
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:18,233
I thought I was interested in data science.

254
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:20,289
I still am, but I think I

255
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,221
like the software development side more.

256
00:11:23,222 --> 00:11:27,845
So I chose Python because it's general purpose,

257
00:11:27,846 --> 00:11:30,469
you can use it for many other uses.

258
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:35,549
And that was, I think I started around March 2015.

259
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,493
So we're learning through Treehouse and

260
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:40,301
back then Kenneth Love was still working

261
00:11:40,302 --> 00:11:42,065
at Treehouse, so he was my teacher.

262
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:43,621
Yeah, yeah.

263
00:11:43,622 --> 00:11:45,805
But it was online and remote.

264
00:11:45,806 --> 00:11:49,461
After, after doing Python, I did Flask, which

265
00:11:49,462 --> 00:11:51,877
I used for my first project is.

266
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:55,201
Which was a portal of some sort.

267
00:11:55,202 --> 00:11:56,921
And then a friend of mine,

268
00:11:56,922 --> 00:11:59,873
Humphrey, introduced me to Django.

269
00:11:59,874 --> 00:12:02,353
We wanted to organize a Django Girls event

270
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:06,353
in Harare for 2016 and we wanted also

271
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:08,881
to organize a PyCon Zimbabwe in 2016.

272
00:12:08,882 --> 00:12:11,049
So for me to learn Django, I used the

273
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,337
Django Girls tutorial and the Django tutorial themselves together.

274
00:12:15,338 --> 00:12:19,113
And then, yeah, that's how I got started with Django.

275
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,891
Yeah, that's really cool.

276
00:12:20,892 --> 00:12:24,003
So, yeah, and I, I love hearing that.

277
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:27,531
I, I feel like 2015 isn't that long ago.

278
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:30,771
It maybe long to people, like, it feels quite

279
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:33,059
recent to me, you know, and you're just learning

280
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,651
and already you're contributing back to the community.

281
00:12:36,652 --> 00:12:40,491
You're leading the Django Girls, you know, being in

282
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:42,899
part of, you know, being involved in the DSF,

283
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,265
I think that's really, it's really inspiring.

284
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,525
So thank you for all the work you do.

285
00:12:49,265 --> 00:12:50,369
Thank you.

286
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,057
Actually, yeah, you're right.

287
00:12:52,058 --> 00:12:54,945
I think I, I started contributing to

288
00:12:54,946 --> 00:12:58,009
Python and Django when I was actually

289
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,265
a beginner, mainly because there wasn't much,

290
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:04,265
Python wasn't very known in Zimbabwe back then and

291
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:07,017
there were no opportunities for us in Zimbabwe.

292
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:07,649
So it was,

293
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:11,337
We thought it best for the community to get together,

294
00:13:11,338 --> 00:13:15,225
organize events and somewhere it led me to the DSF

295
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:17,257
and then I ended up being on the board

296
00:13:17,258 --> 00:13:20,741
for five years as Director, Vice President

297
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:23,165
for two, and President for two years.

298
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,077
And I remember my first event was

299
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:27,037
Django Under the Hood in 2016.

300
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:29,893
I went under the Django Girls umbrella as well.

301
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:32,573
And like I felt like I am a beginner.

302
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:34,429
I couldn't understand like most of

303
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,865
the things they were talking about.

304
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:40,293
I couldn't understand things that are going on at Django

305
00:13:40,294 --> 00:13:44,933
codes because I joined the community as a beginner and

306
00:13:44,934 --> 00:13:48,069
became a leader before I had actually honed up my

307
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,497
skills, you know, in Python, in Django.

308
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,417
But it has also helped me to grow because

309
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:58,185
you let you meet people, you learn from them.

310
00:13:58,186 --> 00:14:00,553
Sometimes it doesn't make sense then, but when you go

311
00:14:00,554 --> 00:14:03,761
back you can go on and reflect and learn and

312
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:05,665
understand the concept that they were talking about.

313
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:09,165
I think I got involved with the community too early.

314
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:15,425
Is there something for you like happen in your first

315
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:18,475
Django Girl that makes you feel like, ok, this is

316
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:19,523
feel like home to me.

317
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:21,819
I want to you know, work more on

318
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,763
this project or like this, you know, initiative.

319
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:28,283
And so my first Django Girls event I was

320
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:32,371
a coach at Django Girls Windhoek in Namibia.

321
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,971
It was part of PyCon Namibia 2016.

322
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:37,043
We, Daniele is always talking about this.

323
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:40,491
We traveled like 33 hours by road

324
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:42,667
to get there because the grant couldn't

325
00:14:42,668 --> 00:14:45,383
cover flights for us, Humphrey and I.

326
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:48,199
So but it was nice we the way

327
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,703
we, we students like high school students.

328
00:14:51,704 --> 00:14:54,439
They were interested students and then they were

329
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,231
more like there were other women who were

330
00:14:57,232 --> 00:15:00,143
like almost my age or younger.

331
00:15:00,144 --> 00:15:01,519
Then there were mature women who

332
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,567
were like older than me almost.

333
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:06,475
Almost like the same age as my mother, you know.

334
00:15:07,535 --> 00:15:07,943
Yeah.

335
00:15:07,944 --> 00:15:10,343
Who were learning Python and Django.

336
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:13,693
Three Django Girls workshop.

337
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:17,333
I've worked at a University for women before.

338
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,893
When I was starting, I think I like, I

339
00:15:19,894 --> 00:15:23,557
like it when we create in environment for women

340
00:15:23,558 --> 00:15:27,237
which is welcoming, where they can learn without being

341
00:15:27,238 --> 00:15:29,845
judged, you know, without being told, you know, it's

342
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:33,157
easy, you know, why can't you get this fast,

343
00:15:33,158 --> 00:15:35,469
quicker and you know, learning at their own pace.

344
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,413
So I think after attending Jungle Girls Windhoek as well

345
00:15:38,414 --> 00:15:41,413
as organizing Django Girls Harare for our Django Girls Harare

346
00:15:41,414 --> 00:15:44,137
which was my second event, we had like primary school

347
00:15:44,138 --> 00:15:48,593
kids who were aged 9, our youngest participants and then

348
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:54,001
we had women in their 40s, 50s and then we

349
00:15:54,002 --> 00:15:55,617
had like the middle aged women.

350
00:15:55,618 --> 00:15:59,513
So yeah, I think because those were like my first events

351
00:15:59,514 --> 00:16:04,405
I saw what Django Girls was doing to women and girls.

352
00:16:04,945 --> 00:16:07,329
And when I went to.

353
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,257
When I then went to Django Under the Hood

354
00:16:10,258 --> 00:16:14,207
in 2016 November, I already like organized two Django

355
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,455
Girls events are in Harare

356
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:20,095
also attended Django Girls Windhoek in Namibia.

357
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:22,871
Then I thought we have the problem

358
00:16:22,872 --> 00:16:25,375
of women being underrepresented in tech was

359
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:27,567
something that was peculiar to Africa.

360
00:16:27,568 --> 00:16:30,551
In my girls in my class when we're doing in high

361
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:33,471
school I did math, physics and computing for A level and

362
00:16:33,472 --> 00:16:36,253
with two girls in our physics class out of 20.

363
00:16:36,254 --> 00:16:37,820
So we're like 10%.

364
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:42,519
And for my degree we started like we about 110 and we

365
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,218
were about 10 or 11 women by the time we graduated we

366
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:50,633
were around 45 to 50 and we were six women.

367
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,897
So I had grown, you know, used to being

368
00:16:52,898 --> 00:16:56,193
10% of the population because you are in STEM.

369
00:16:56,194 --> 00:16:59,137
So when I went to Django Under the Hood, I was surprised

370
00:16:59,138 --> 00:17:01,737
when I walked into the room for the first time and I

371
00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:06,002
was like, oh, there are so many white men here.

372
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:08,851
And I could count the women who were there at

373
00:17:08,852 --> 00:17:11,267
the event, you know, so then that's when I realized,

374
00:17:11,268 --> 00:17:14,771
okay, so probably this is what Ola and Ola had

375
00:17:14,772 --> 00:17:16,459
in mind when they started Django Girls.

376
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,555
And that's when I realized what Django Girls,

377
00:17:19,556 --> 00:17:23,426
you know, means to the tech community globally.

378
00:17:23,427 --> 00:17:25,603
Not just for me as a Zimbabwean

379
00:17:25,604 --> 00:17:28,435
in Zimbabwe, but everywhere in the world.

380
00:17:28,436 --> 00:17:30,883
We kind of have the same problems where we have

381
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:34,475
fewer women in tech than compared to any other field.

382
00:17:34,476 --> 00:17:37,227
So I guess that's why I ended up working for them,

383
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:40,827
because the course makes sense to me even up to now.

384
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:42,731
I can relate to it.

385
00:17:42,732 --> 00:17:46,395
Yeah, I totally understand because I also study physics and

386
00:17:46,396 --> 00:17:50,787
my class also only 10% and like, half of the

387
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:53,883
women who studying physics actually don't want to be there.

388
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:56,163
So it's very tough.

389
00:17:56,164 --> 00:18:00,375
And I wish when I was younger I have the same insight.

390
00:18:00,376 --> 00:18:03,255
Oh, maybe we should create a space like Django Girls.

391
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:05,515
But, well, now we're here.

392
00:18:06,255 --> 00:18:10,199
Yeah, Yeah, I think it's really important.

393
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,215
And I mean, even now, it's still.

394
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:15,943
Representation of women is still an issue in the,

395
00:18:15,944 --> 00:18:17,439
in our community, in the Python

396
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,351
and Django, in open source.

397
00:18:19,352 --> 00:18:21,063
Not quite there yet. So.

398
00:18:21,064 --> 00:18:23,199
Yeah, but we are trying.

399
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,783
I know, like, there are people like you

400
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:27,105
who are trying, you know, and that's.

401
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,425
I think we need more people to

402
00:18:29,426 --> 00:18:32,513
actually realize that this is a problem.

403
00:18:32,514 --> 00:18:35,785
And it's not because there's no women.

404
00:18:35,786 --> 00:18:38,353
It's not because women are not interested.

405
00:18:38,354 --> 00:18:39,345
We are trying.

406
00:18:39,346 --> 00:18:40,049
We try.

407
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,649
But maybe there is something else that is the

408
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,737
environment, like you mentioned, maybe women are being judged

409
00:18:47,738 --> 00:18:50,405
more and it's just not a safe environment.

410
00:18:51,305 --> 00:18:53,585
So I'm really glad to hear that there are

411
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:56,321
initiatives like the Django Girls to make it

412
00:18:56,322 --> 00:18:57,629
to make it more inclusive

413
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,085
and, you know, more welcoming.

414
00:18:59,086 --> 00:19:00,781
But you're taking on another challenge.

415
00:19:00,782 --> 00:19:04,981
You are now, like, studying overseas and, like,

416
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:07,245
you know, how does it feel for you?

417
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:10,533
You're in a new place and maybe also, like in the

418
00:19:10,534 --> 00:19:13,117
class, there isn't a lot of people who are like you.

419
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:19,905
So, yeah, I think, honestly, I feel so old now because.

420
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:23,185
No, never say that.

421
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:24,607
2009.

422
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:29,573
So it has taken me 15 years to pursue

423
00:19:29,574 --> 00:19:32,149
a master's in software engineering, which is something that

424
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,605
I wanted to do for a very long time.

425
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:37,405
I'm excited, but I'm also.

426
00:19:37,406 --> 00:19:39,301
I'm looking forward to it.

427
00:19:39,302 --> 00:19:42,181
I am hoping that I can manage the

428
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,821
pressure of being back in school again after,

429
00:19:44,822 --> 00:19:48,125
you know, many years of taking a break.

430
00:19:48,126 --> 00:19:49,333
I've done some courses in

431
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:52,525
between, but full time education.

432
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:53,581
This is the first time that I'm

433
00:19:53,582 --> 00:19:56,077
doing full time education after graduating.

434
00:19:56,078 --> 00:19:58,191
So I'm looking forward to it.

435
00:19:58,192 --> 00:19:59,375
It's a new challenge.

436
00:19:59,376 --> 00:20:02,031
I'm waiting to see what it's going to

437
00:20:02,032 --> 00:20:03,631
look like next week when I start.

438
00:20:03,632 --> 00:20:07,215
Because here, the way the courses are structured is

439
00:20:07,216 --> 00:20:10,039
different from what I am used to in Zimbabwe.

440
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,015
You have a set timetable.

441
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:15,543
Back in Zimbabwe, where you know, I have these courses

442
00:20:15,544 --> 00:20:20,071
here and then like your day, you know how your

443
00:20:20,072 --> 00:20:22,545
timetable is going to look like for the whole semester.

444
00:20:22,546 --> 00:20:26,113
But now here they do like you do two courses at a time.

445
00:20:26,114 --> 00:20:26,945
Okay.

446
00:20:26,946 --> 00:20:28,449
Yeah, out of four.

447
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,241
So I have the schedule for the first two courses.

448
00:20:31,242 --> 00:20:35,985
Then we, we write exams, we do the other two courses.

449
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:37,065
Okay.

450
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:38,553
Beginning in the middle.

451
00:20:38,554 --> 00:20:39,033
Yeah.

452
00:20:39,034 --> 00:20:41,593
Then you as you, you kind of

453
00:20:41,594 --> 00:20:44,257
like you have few hours of lectures.

454
00:20:44,258 --> 00:20:45,841
But they say it's.

455
00:20:45,842 --> 00:20:47,769
You have to do a 40 hour week when

456
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,457
you left like maybe at most probably you have

457
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,446
like six hours, maybe 12 hours of lectures.

458
00:20:53,447 --> 00:20:55,537
But you're supposed to be 40 hour weeks.

459
00:20:55,538 --> 00:20:58,121
So the other study is supposed

460
00:20:58,122 --> 00:21:00,001
to be either in group work.

461
00:21:00,002 --> 00:21:01,825
They do a lot of group work here.

462
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:04,569
I haven't met my classmates so I don't know what's my.

463
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,537
All my group is going to look like.

464
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:11,081
But you also have to like pace yourself, be organized and be

465
00:21:11,082 --> 00:21:14,801
able to study on your own to make those 40 hours.

466
00:21:14,802 --> 00:21:19,145
So yeah, it's going to be a new challenge.

467
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:21,497
Yeah. Yeah.

468
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:25,225
That's a very like brave like you know, kind of

469
00:21:25,226 --> 00:21:28,561
jump because I know like for women, like a lot

470
00:21:28,562 --> 00:21:30,929
of women, luckily I don't have that problem.

471
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,369
But like with some women, oh, they kind of take a

472
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:35,529
break from their career, you know, take care of the family

473
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,961
and like, you know, have to start something again like back

474
00:21:38,962 --> 00:21:41,249
in tech or like it's a huge challenge.

475
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,735
Yeah, yeah. For me. Okay.

476
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:46,815
So for me it's taking a break. Okay.

477
00:21:46,816 --> 00:21:48,135
To go back to school.

478
00:21:48,136 --> 00:21:50,239
But I'm still single so I

479
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,527
don't have a family to consider.

480
00:21:51,528 --> 00:21:53,079
I think that makes it easy.

481
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,527
It's just a matter of folding up my resident, the

482
00:21:57,528 --> 00:22:01,055
apartment that I was living in Harare and coming here

483
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:03,855
and set up another apartment for two years.

484
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:07,095
And then we see how that goes after two years.

485
00:22:07,096 --> 00:22:10,099
But yeah, it was, I.

486
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,339
Maybe it's because the application process for to study in

487
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,691
Sweden, it takes a bit of some time because I

488
00:22:17,692 --> 00:22:20,795
started looking at the programs in October last year.

489
00:22:20,796 --> 00:22:23,811
I was hoping to get a scholarship with the

490
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:27,843
Swedish Institute, which I did, and they opened the.

491
00:22:27,844 --> 00:22:29,715
They announced the programs that they were

492
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:33,075
going to fund in 15, 15 November.

493
00:22:33,076 --> 00:22:35,555
So I now knew which programs that I wanted to apply to.

494
00:22:35,556 --> 00:22:37,935
And then the application closed in the

495
00:22:37,936 --> 00:22:40,330
15th of January, and then deadline for

496
00:22:40,331 --> 00:22:42,692
payment of application fees was one February.

497
00:22:42,693 --> 00:22:45,391
And then they opened the scholarship the 12th

498
00:22:45,392 --> 00:22:48,090
of February and closed the 28th of February.

499
00:22:48,091 --> 00:22:50,789
So I had to wait for the admission

500
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,488
for the 21st of March and then wait

501
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:56,439
for the scholarship announcement the 25th of April.

502
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,695
So I guess with,

503
00:22:57,696 --> 00:23:01,415
through all that waiting and as well as

504
00:23:01,416 --> 00:23:04,321
then after knowing and then doing the application

505
00:23:04,322 --> 00:23:07,121
for the residence permit and you kind of

506
00:23:07,122 --> 00:23:09,545
have time to prepare yourself mentally.

507
00:23:09,546 --> 00:23:12,169
Am I going to leave the country now?

508
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,193
Am I going to focus things? Yeah.

509
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:16,553
By the time that you have to live in August. Yeah.

510
00:23:16,554 --> 00:23:23,529
You kind of like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know.

511
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:23,801
Yeah.

512
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,073
You are mentally prepared to say, okay, I'm now

513
00:23:26,074 --> 00:23:28,921
leaving this and I'm setting a new chapter.

514
00:23:28,922 --> 00:23:30,495
We'll see how it goes.

515
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:30,887
Yeah.

516
00:23:30,888 --> 00:23:32,355
I'm afraid of the cold.

517
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:37,275
In the winter.

518
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:41,195
So I don't know how it's going to look like.

519
00:23:42,335 --> 00:23:43,047
I've been.

520
00:23:43,048 --> 00:23:45,247
I have been to the West, and I think

521
00:23:45,248 --> 00:23:50,783
November in 2016 in Amsterdam, but it was in,

522
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,711
it was cold, but it wasn't that cold.

523
00:23:53,712 --> 00:23:56,503
It's very cold in February.

524
00:23:56,504 --> 00:23:58,223
In January and February.

525
00:23:58,224 --> 00:24:02,653
And then I was in Prague for Ubuntu Summit in.

526
00:24:02,654 --> 00:24:03,653
In November as well.

527
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:05,085
Early November.

528
00:24:05,086 --> 00:24:06,597
Yeah, both times were early November,

529
00:24:06,598 --> 00:24:08,685
so it wasn't that cold.

530
00:24:08,686 --> 00:24:11,405
So I have no idea.

531
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:13,725
And I remember when I was.

532
00:24:13,726 --> 00:24:15,053
When I was coming for. Yeah.

533
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:18,645
To DjangoCon, Europe in June, I left Zimbabwe.

534
00:24:18,646 --> 00:24:19,825
It was very warm.

535
00:24:20,365 --> 00:24:22,197
Then when I got to South Africa,

536
00:24:22,198 --> 00:24:24,525
it was like 14 degrees Celsius.

537
00:24:24,526 --> 00:24:26,215
And like when we getting off the

538
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:30,255
plane, it was windy and cold.

539
00:24:30,256 --> 00:24:32,663
And I'm like, okay, this is.

540
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:34,103
This is at a time that I'm thinking

541
00:24:34,104 --> 00:24:37,087
of leaving Zimbabwe, which is like 300 days

542
00:24:37,088 --> 00:24:40,431
of sun and warm, to relocate to Sweden.

543
00:24:40,432 --> 00:24:42,479
And I'm struggling with 14 degrees

544
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,343
Celsius, something they call summer in.

545
00:24:46,344 --> 00:24:47,695
In the West.

546
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:48,955
Yeah, yeah.

547
00:24:50,335 --> 00:24:51,583
Because your summer.

548
00:24:51,584 --> 00:24:53,111
Because the summer here is as good

549
00:24:53,112 --> 00:24:55,335
as my winter in Zimbabwe, you know?

550
00:24:55,336 --> 00:24:58,033
So I was like, am I really serious about this?

551
00:24:58,034 --> 00:25:01,377
Another thing that I have, like, still not getting

552
00:25:01,378 --> 00:25:04,017
used to maybe, probably because I live in London.

553
00:25:04,018 --> 00:25:07,321
Is that the snow and the slipperiness of the floor?

554
00:25:07,322 --> 00:25:08,753
Because we don't snow a lot in

555
00:25:08,754 --> 00:25:11,585
London, only once every few years.

556
00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:13,369
But, like, every time I remember,

557
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,969
I've been to Sweden twice.

558
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,305
Both of them are in the winter.

559
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,845
It's very cold and slippery.

560
00:25:19,865 --> 00:25:23,409
You have to buy those special things to put on your

561
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:28,299
boots so you don't sleep and yeah, yeah I haven't.

562
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,187
I haven't taken care of the boots thing

563
00:25:30,188 --> 00:25:31,843
but I hope to get to it.

564
00:25:31,844 --> 00:25:34,659
Yeah but people there will teach you.

565
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:40,427
And yeah, yeah even started regretting living Zimbabwe age but yeah

566
00:25:40,428 --> 00:25:42,963
in terms of the weather I just been home so far

567
00:25:42,964 --> 00:25:46,547
not as cold so we'll see how the wind goes.

568
00:25:46,548 --> 00:25:47,355
Right.

569
00:25:47,356 --> 00:25:49,123
What do you think is the role

570
00:25:49,124 --> 00:25:51,955
of Django Girls for the community?

571
00:25:55,175 --> 00:25:59,063
Okay, so I think Django Girls is in an

572
00:25:59,064 --> 00:26:04,559
important role in the community to close the gender

573
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,751
gap for within the tech industry we have so

574
00:26:08,752 --> 00:26:11,631
many men compared to women and what we are

575
00:26:11,632 --> 00:26:15,159
doing is we are providing free resources for women

576
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,703
to organize workshops that introduce women to programming.

577
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:22,607
With Python and Django we have done two surveys so far,

578
00:26:22,608 --> 00:26:29,011
one in 2017, 2018 and another one recently which we

579
00:26:29,012 --> 00:26:32,291
haven't published the results for and but what we have

580
00:26:32,292 --> 00:26:36,123
found is some of our attendees quite a good percentage

581
00:26:36,124 --> 00:26:39,291
I can't remember I think about was it 21% last

582
00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:44,115
time it actually transitioned from their careers to working to

583
00:26:44,116 --> 00:26:46,459
take in different roles.

584
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,411
Obviously after attending our workshop is still it won't be

585
00:26:50,412 --> 00:26:53,227
enough for someone but mostly go on to learn.

586
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:55,999
You know about 7, 75% they continue learning

587
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,103
with learning Python, learning programming until they actually

588
00:26:59,104 --> 00:27:02,295
transition to working to take in different roles.

589
00:27:02,296 --> 00:27:04,695
So while it takes time for us to have

590
00:27:04,696 --> 00:27:08,263
results, I think we as a community doing an

591
00:27:08,264 --> 00:27:12,535
important role in introducing women to programming and having

592
00:27:12,536 --> 00:27:15,315
more people women involved in tech.

593
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:19,455
So how, I'm curious, how can, how can the

594
00:27:19,456 --> 00:27:23,205
community so support, you know, the Django Girls Foundation?

595
00:27:23,206 --> 00:27:27,453
I know your fundraising like is there active fundraising

596
00:27:27,454 --> 00:27:31,789
that people can support right now or what other

597
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:35,525
ways can we support the Django Girls community?

598
00:27:35,526 --> 00:27:36,781
Okay, so we are always

599
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:40,445
fundraising all throughout the year.

600
00:27:40,446 --> 00:27:42,557
We welcome donations anytime.

601
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:45,949
People can reach out to me via LinkedIn or using

602
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:50,185
the Django Girls website and I can give them details

603
00:27:50,186 --> 00:27:53,345
on how they can donate to Django Girls.

604
00:27:53,346 --> 00:27:58,385
Also we always look for companies that can have their

605
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:00,721
employees donate their time to work on our resources.

606
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:02,521
That's something that we welcome as

607
00:28:02,522 --> 00:28:05,145
well and we're always looking for.

608
00:28:05,146 --> 00:28:07,089
We are hoping to have new content

609
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:09,041
and we have some projects underway.

610
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:10,137
New projects underway.

611
00:28:10,138 --> 00:28:12,105
And that would be helpful if we

612
00:28:12,106 --> 00:28:14,489
had partners to work with us.

613
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,137
We went to do a crowdfunding campaign but

614
00:28:17,138 --> 00:28:19,209
I was a bit away because of the

615
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,781
relocation and our osmosis was also on holiday.

616
00:28:22,782 --> 00:28:24,725
We're not sure if, I'm not sure if we'll

617
00:28:24,726 --> 00:28:26,749
continue with that this year or it might be

618
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,501
for next year, but we always welcome donations anytime.

619
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:32,989
Yeah, we do have a Patreon page

620
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,613
that they can contribute to also.

621
00:28:34,614 --> 00:28:36,149
They can sign up for monthly

622
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,509
donations through our Patreon page.

623
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,869
I can share the link as well?

624
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,453
Yes, please. Yeah.

625
00:28:41,454 --> 00:28:43,509
If they want to be ongoing

626
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,005
supporters, contribute monthly with that.

627
00:28:46,006 --> 00:28:47,029
We are also on GitHub

628
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,605
Sponsors, companies and individuals alike can also

629
00:28:49,606 --> 00:28:51,189
sign up to support us through the.

630
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,597
And then we have PayPal and Stripe

631
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,253
if people want to donate through that.

632
00:28:55,254 --> 00:28:58,045
We have set up various channels for people to donate.

633
00:28:58,046 --> 00:29:02,365
I think Django Girl is a very good initiative.

634
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:06,381
I think companies, they are maybe sponsoring events

635
00:29:06,382 --> 00:29:08,221
and stuff but I think if you want

636
00:29:08,222 --> 00:29:12,213
to target certain group of people in a

637
00:29:12,214 --> 00:29:14,745
community, I think maybe consider Django Girls.

638
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:16,757
Yes.

639
00:29:16,758 --> 00:29:19,461
I hope we have more companies come to support us.

640
00:29:19,462 --> 00:29:21,637
We've had some companies that supported us for

641
00:29:21,638 --> 00:29:23,857
quite a number of years but I think

642
00:29:23,858 --> 00:29:26,633
Covid sort of like upset everything and it

643
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:29,009
also did affect our sponsorship as well.

644
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,833
So we are hoping to get new sponsors

645
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:33,345
to continue to support our week as well.

646
00:29:33,346 --> 00:29:34,025
Yeah.

647
00:29:34,026 --> 00:29:37,513
So yeah, you have talked about a lot of things

648
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:40,625
so any plans except you know, you're setting up the

649
00:29:40,626 --> 00:29:43,769
cloud funding and stuff but like anything for Django Girls.

650
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:46,481
Anything for yourself. Yeah.

651
00:29:46,482 --> 00:29:47,137
Okay.

652
00:29:47,138 --> 00:29:53,411
For myself I want to complete my Masters so I

653
00:29:53,412 --> 00:29:57,175
hope to do that as do do that very well.

654
00:29:58,635 --> 00:30:01,579
We have a three week roll call to see how you're doing.

655
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,275
So I hope by then I'll be doing

656
00:30:04,276 --> 00:30:07,827
fine so that I, I keep my scholarship.

657
00:30:07,828 --> 00:30:11,443
I think by now I know I want to

658
00:30:11,444 --> 00:30:15,163
to work in open source after I graduate and

659
00:30:15,164 --> 00:30:17,919
there's a role that I'm aiming for that I

660
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,167
keep checking whether they've hired, hired, hired.

661
00:30:21,168 --> 00:30:25,071
So that's something that I'm targeting to get after

662
00:30:25,072 --> 00:30:27,583
I complete my studies in the next two years.

663
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:31,271
And then for Django Girls we, we have a plan to

664
00:30:31,272 --> 00:30:35,775
start a boot camp but it isn't quite rolled out yet.

665
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,879
It will start in the uk so I'm hoping that we

666
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:45,581
will be able to introduce that maybe 25, 2025 or 2026

667
00:30:45,582 --> 00:30:48,661
instead of just giving women a one day workshop.

668
00:30:48,662 --> 00:30:52,285
We provide resources for them to learn for a number of

669
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:56,269
weeks and also we are aiming for it to be flexible

670
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:00,709
to cater for women who have child care issues, you know.

671
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,157
Yeah.

672
00:31:01,158 --> 00:31:03,461
So that they can be able to participate in

673
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:06,069
their own pace and hopefully that will lead also

674
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,997
to mentorship and for them to get new roles.

675
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:11,627
So that's the one thing that

676
00:31:11,628 --> 00:31:13,883
we have been hinting about.

677
00:31:13,884 --> 00:31:17,411
Plans are just not set yet, but yeah, that's something

678
00:31:17,412 --> 00:31:21,835
that we hope to work towards in the coming years.

679
00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:23,987
Yeah, that sounds interesting.

680
00:31:23,988 --> 00:31:27,291
Yeah, I think that will be useful to have, like

681
00:31:27,292 --> 00:31:29,819
you said, more than just, you know, one day workshop

682
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,275
and have a series of, you know, ongoing training.

683
00:31:33,276 --> 00:31:34,819
I think that's very exciting.

684
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,203
I'm looking forward to learn more about

685
00:31:36,204 --> 00:31:38,927
it and hopefully we can help. We can help.

686
00:31:38,928 --> 00:31:40,959
Especially I'm in the uk, I'm having help.

687
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:46,263
Yeah, that's really good and it's very good to hear

688
00:31:46,264 --> 00:31:49,287
and thank you for sharing so many stories with us

689
00:31:49,288 --> 00:31:54,367
and yeah, I think it's a very enjoyable chat with

690
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:57,215
you and know more about Django Girls.

691
00:31:57,216 --> 00:31:58,919
You know, I always heard about the name.

692
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,327
I try to help out once in a while.

693
00:32:01,328 --> 00:32:03,567
Not a lot, but then like now I understand,

694
00:32:03,568 --> 00:32:05,591
like more like, you know about Django Girls.

695
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:07,375
And also interesting story.

696
00:32:07,376 --> 00:32:10,131
Moving so far away to somewhere so cold

697
00:32:10,132 --> 00:32:13,095
and you have to build your own furniture.

698
00:32:15,075 --> 00:32:15,619
Yeah.

699
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,035
So thank you so much and thank you, Anna.

700
00:32:19,036 --> 00:32:20,715
Thank you, thank you for having me.
