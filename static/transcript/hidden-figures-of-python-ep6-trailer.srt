1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,750
People.

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:04,540
It's the people of Python community who give

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,590
you that warmth.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,420
We connected that Raspberry Pi prototype

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,700
which helped in monitoring the power

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,620
fluctuations or power cuts in a particular

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,550
building in my college.

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,790
Whenever I am sad, I am not happy

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,220
working professionally with my job or any

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,900
stress I have. It's always the women in this

11
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,710
community that I reach out to.

12
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,060
Python meetups and conferences are I think

13
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,150
they are my savior.

14
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,630
While dealing that stress immediately,

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,070
mMy gateway is come to any meet up

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,670
immediately.

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,160
I keep searching is there any meet up.

18
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,110
Open source detoxing?

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,360
I have brother and my brother is a special child.

20
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,670
He is autistic but I dont know how can I

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,270
help them.

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,240
Are there any communities that are helping?

23
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,390
And then I came to Python community.

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,990
This is what I observed being in Python

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,600
community is that

26
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,190
how well people with disabilities or mental

27
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,910
disabilities, physical disabilities are

28
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,040
doing wonders.

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,070
This encouraged me a lot and also was one

30
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,350
of the aspects that I always wanted to

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,680
emotionally get connected

32
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,710
and give my best.

33
