00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,440
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:24,120
Welcome to PyPodcats, the Hidden

3
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:26,470
Figures of Python podcast series.

4
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:29,270
The PyPodcats is, a podcast

5
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:30,590
highlighting voices from

6
00:00:30,591 --> 00:00:32,150
the underrepresented group

7
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:33,750
members of the Python community.

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,550
So we do have a Code of Conduct

9
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:37,910
that is following

10
00:00:37,911 --> 00:00:39,910
the PSF Code of Conduct.

11
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:40,950
And if you're interested

12
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:42,070
to know more, you can always,

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,070
check out our website.

14
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:46,230
Very excited to be back because

15
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:50,620
this is 2025, probably the first

16
00:00:50,621 --> 00:00:53,030
guest for our 2025 podcast.

17
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,050
My name is Georgi and I'm one

18
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:57,810
of the PyPodcats hosts

19
00:00:57,811 --> 00:01:00,290
and I'm based in Amsterdam.

20
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:03,090
Also one of the PSF Director

21
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:05,090
of the Board.

22
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:06,650
And to you, Mariatta.

23
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:07,890
Hi everybody.

24
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:09,730
I'm excited that we are

25
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:12,050
resuming the PyPodcast series.

26
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,610
My name is Mariatta, I'm based

27
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:16,970
in Vancouver, Canada and I'm

28
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:18,050
in the Python community.

29
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:19,970
I've been contributing for many

30
00:01:19,971 --> 00:01:22,370
years as open source contributor.

31
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,450
I'm also one of the Python core

32
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,110
developers and, and I'm also

33
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:28,350
involved in the PyLadies community.

34
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:30,830
Our guest today is Tamara.

35
00:01:30,831 --> 00:01:33,150
Tamara, can you introduce yourself?

36
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:33,590
Hi.

37
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:34,990
Thank you so much for having me.

38
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:36,590
I'm also really excited

39
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:39,070
to be the first guest for 2025.

40
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,950
So I'm Tamara.

41
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:44,510
I, am currently an Open

42
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:46,070
Source Software Engineer.

43
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:46,910
That's my title

44
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:48,590
at a company called Probabl.

45
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:50,550
Probabl is the brand ambassador

46
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:51,860
for scikit-learn.

47
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,090
And my job there is I work

48
00:01:55,091 --> 00:01:55,970
in the open source team

49
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:57,410
so I'm sponsored to work

50
00:01:57,411 --> 00:01:58,890
on open source packages.

51
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:01,290
One of my jobs, includes

52
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:02,730
maintaining Fairlearn that I

53
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:04,010
hope we're going to talk about

54
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:05,450
a bit more later about.

55
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:07,889
And I do contribute to scikit-learn

56
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,009
and I've contributed to another

57
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,450
package recently called Spops.

58
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:13,530
At the same time, some of my time

59
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:15,260
in the week goes to research.

60
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,650
That's going to become

61
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:17,770
my master thesis.

62
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,400
I am part of a program that's mainly

63
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:23,000
about computational linguistics,

64
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:24,800
but also has some cognitive science.

65
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:26,400
Yes, that's me at the moment.

66
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:27,360
I've also been involved,

67
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:28,640
I guess in the Python community

68
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:30,400
for over a decade.

69
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,480
So there's a lot different.

70
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,160
Yes, since 2012 it's been a bit.

71
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:40,320
Wow, it's been a while.

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,840
Yeah.

73
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,440
That's crazy.

74
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,310
So, yeah, you were just

75
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:48,190
talking about Fairlearn.

76
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:49,830
So what is Fairlearn about?

77
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:52,990
It sounds like a game for me.

78
00:02:52,991 --> 00:02:54,266
With the name

79
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:55,710
Learning Fair.

80
00:02:55,711 --> 00:02:56,070
Yeah.

81
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:59,150
So Fairlearn is a, I guess the best

82
00:02:59,151 --> 00:03:00,710
way to describe it is a toolkit

83
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:02,950
is a library that it provides tools

84
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:05,790
for data scientists to work on.

85
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,910
Increase the AI safety

86
00:03:07,911 --> 00:03:09,550
of their applications.

87
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,520
So I think if we don't go too

88
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:16,320
deep we can think of FairLearn

89
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,680
as a library that provides

90
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:21,240
metrics and also provides a

91
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:24,440
specific kind of methods for

92
00:03:24,441 --> 00:03:26,800
assessment and mitigation of

93
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:28,480
unfairness in this case.

94
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:30,680
But it is based on a specific type of

95
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:32,640
fairness, which is group fairness.

96
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:34,080
And what does that mean?

97
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,280
I think it's important to address

98
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,740
is that we have tools for people to

99
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:41,980
evaluate how a model would perform

100
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:44,060
for different groups of people.

101
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:46,100
And in Fairlearn we call this

102
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,300
groups of people sensitive

103
00:03:47,301 --> 00:03:49,620
features but they can be any kind

104
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:50,740
of subgroup that you want

105
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:52,340
to make sure the algorithm or

106
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:53,740
the model performs fair for.

107
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:54,860
We can think of any

108
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:57,420
examples like sex or race or any,

109
00:03:57,421 --> 00:03:58,660
any really combination

110
00:03:58,661 --> 00:04:00,060
of the subgroups as well.

111
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:01,740
This is based on something called

112
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,330
disaggregated evaluation.

113
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:05,690
And these are the metrics

114
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:07,850
and the other methods help with.

115
00:04:07,851 --> 00:04:09,290
Do you have any like case

116
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,210
study of a company

117
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:13,850
or a project that uses Fairlearn?

118
00:04:13,851 --> 00:04:15,330
I love this question because

119
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:16,410
it's a, it's an interesting

120
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:17,529
problem that we have.

121
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,410
We do really love working

122
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:22,330
on this and it's part of my

123
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,410
the research does, I read

124
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:25,850
papers around this method.

125
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,090
But one of the core problems is

126
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:30,810
that a lot of the people who do use

127
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:32,410
the library and there are plenty

128
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:33,850
because I think in December

129
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,590
there were half a million downloads.

130
00:04:37,591 --> 00:04:39,270
Whoa, is that.

131
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:41,510
Yes, it's big and it's

132
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:42,990
interesting that it's really hard

133
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,590
to get any data about it.

134
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:47,110
And this is as somebody that's

135
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:48,550
just getting in this area

136
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:50,890
from an academic standpoint,

137
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,150
I wasn't in it before.

138
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:53,310
I learned from the senior

139
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:54,830
researchers that a lot of the

140
00:04:54,831 --> 00:04:56,910
companies do not really want to

141
00:04:56,911 --> 00:04:58,950
discuss the usage of these kinds

142
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:00,470
of tools and would definitely

143
00:05:00,471 --> 00:05:02,670
not make any of their data sets

144
00:05:02,671 --> 00:05:03,030
available.

145
00:05:03,031 --> 00:05:05,350
But if you go on the website

146
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:07,010
I think this is one of the biggest.

147
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,530
Despite the excellent metrics

148
00:05:09,531 --> 00:05:11,990
and really careful editorial,

149
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:13,290
decisions that are made and we

150
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,010
really do not add anything that

151
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:16,650
hasn't been mindfully vetted.

152
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:18,450
In a sense one of the biggest things

153
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,050
that we focus on is education.

154
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:21,650
So if you, if somebody opens the

155
00:05:21,651 --> 00:05:23,170
website there is a place with

156
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:25,770
example notebooks and there in the

157
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:27,730
example notebooks there is one

158
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,170
white paper that was made by

159
00:05:30,171 --> 00:05:32,130
Microsoft who started the library

160
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,250
many years ago.

161
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,450
But now it's community led.

162
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,520
Ernst and Young, if I pronounce

163
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:38,960
that right, that worked on

164
00:05:38,961 --> 00:05:41,040
credit fairness in the states

165
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:44,880
between male and female applicants.

166
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:45,960
And it's a really interesting

167
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:48,070
case study to read of course,

168
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:49,440
one can assume there are

169
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:51,520
constantly this kind of scandals

170
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:53,280
coming out in the open.

171
00:05:53,281 --> 00:05:54,720
You could assume that somebody

172
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,320
uses something somewhere.

173
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:58,040
Sometimes people from governments or

174
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,240
from different institutions come

175
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:00,480
to our community calls which are

176
00:06:00,481 --> 00:06:02,040
by the way open for everyone.

177
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:04,340
They happen every second week

178
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:05,980
at 6pm Berlin time.

179
00:06:05,981 --> 00:06:07,140
I don't know what is that

180
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:08,820
in other time zones?

181
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,260
Easily.

182
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:11,780
People can easily find it

183
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:12,740
on the website.

184
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:13,940
The time zone problem.

185
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,020
Yeah, most of the people that

186
00:06:16,021 --> 00:06:18,020
contribute are coming from the U.S.

187
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:19,780
so they, they always say their

188
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:21,540
time and I always forget because I'm

189
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:22,820
in Europe, in Berlin.

190
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,540
Yes.

191
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,260
So this is a very

192
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:25,900
interesting question.

193
00:06:25,901 --> 00:06:27,580
And if anybody's listening

194
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:28,260
to this that's using

195
00:06:28,261 --> 00:06:30,020
Fairlearn, we have a survey,

196
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,850
that we just recently made.

197
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,250
One of our maintainers, Michael

198
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:38,330
created it for this specific purpose

199
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,090
because we are a bit in the dark.

200
00:06:40,091 --> 00:06:41,930
We would like to serve the community

201
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:43,090
better, but we would

202
00:06:43,091 --> 00:06:44,250
need the community to,

203
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:46,410
to be brave to talk to us about

204
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,250
how they use the tools.

205
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,530
Yeah, okay.

206
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:50,810
Yeah.

207
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,050
Share the link with us.

208
00:06:52,051 --> 00:06:54,090
Maybe, we'll share it when

209
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,690
would be amazing.

210
00:06:55,691 --> 00:06:56,880
Yeah, yeah.

211
00:06:56,881 --> 00:06:58,800
So people who use Fairlearn

212
00:06:58,801 --> 00:07:00,480
share how you actually use it.

213
00:07:00,481 --> 00:07:03,360
Yeah, I find it, it's interesting.

214
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:05,280
Do you think people hesitant

215
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:07,160
to share like they don't want, they

216
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:09,000
don't want to tell that they are

217
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:11,120
using Fairlearn or what is,

218
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:12,880
is there a reason they are not?

219
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:16,240
I think a lot of the models

220
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:19,760
will have maybe non ideal results.

221
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:20,720
Now this is another

222
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:21,600
interesting question.

223
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:24,110
So one thing is to assess unfairness.

224
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,630
You would start for example

225
00:07:25,631 --> 00:07:27,190
with defining your sensitive

226
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:29,150
groups and understanding what

227
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:30,470
your specific use case is.

228
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:31,630
It always has to be specific.

229
00:07:31,631 --> 00:07:33,110
And then you would pick the right

230
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:34,790
metric that different metrics

231
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:35,990
like demographic parity

232
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:37,950
of equal odds, you can assume what

233
00:07:37,951 --> 00:07:39,350
they mean maybe by the name

234
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:40,270
where we can discuss them.

235
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:42,830
But after that you can use some of

236
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:44,830
these to assess how the model works.

237
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,510
In case of demographic parity,

238
00:07:46,511 --> 00:07:47,910
for example, is this you know, equal

239
00:07:47,911 --> 00:07:49,810
for the demographics involved?

240
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:51,810
But the mitigation itself,

241
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,090
it's a, we do provide some tools

242
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:57,210
for mitigation in the library.

243
00:07:57,211 --> 00:07:58,410
And there are many, many

244
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,690
other ways to do mitigation.

245
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:02,650
But mitigation, it's really not easy.

246
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:05,249
It's a very case to case, basis

247
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,250
and the answer might be in your

248
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:09,330
data, in adjusting your predictions,

249
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:11,410
in balancing some other ways.

250
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:12,410
There are other ways

251
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:15,090
of mitigating with intermediate

252
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:16,330
representations and so on.

253
00:08:16,331 --> 00:08:17,570
It can get pretty complicated.

254
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:19,410
But only you can do this

255
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:20,370
in your own use.

256
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,750
And it's not easy to do after

257
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:24,950
you've set up everything to redo.

258
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:26,510
Because fairness has to be

259
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:28,590
from the very beginning considered.

260
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,110
When you create a product

261
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:31,910
or a model, it has to.

262
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,070
The idea of it being fair has

263
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:35,870
to be woven into the whole process.

264
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:37,470
And I think a lot of people maybe,

265
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:40,030
yes, they assess at the end and then

266
00:08:40,031 --> 00:08:41,070
I don't know what they do.

267
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:41,870
Right.

268
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:43,870
What if like halfway through

269
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:45,950
they say, oh, actually

270
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:47,510
I forgot something that we

271
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:49,190
should actually add on to it.

272
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:50,110
What did they do?

273
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:51,880
I don't know.

274
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:53,680
I would like to know what people do.

275
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,560
I, I recently became a, part

276
00:08:57,561 --> 00:08:59,080
of a very, very big Slack

277
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,280
channel and I was asking people,

278
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:02,880
hi, how do you use fairness?

279
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:03,960
Please tell me something.

280
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,240
Nobody told me anything still,

281
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:07,040
but maybe somebody will.

282
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:10,040
Okay, yeah, hopefully we get to

283
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:11,840
share your survey and so hopefully

284
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:14,480
you get responses and you get

285
00:09:14,481 --> 00:09:16,490
to learn more about the user.

286
00:09:16,491 --> 00:09:17,850
I do believe there are some maybe

287
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:19,610
like big companies have idea

288
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:21,210
about this in their own internal

289
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:22,490
teams and senior researchers.

290
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:23,690
But you cannot say

291
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:24,730
anything about this.

292
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,810
Yeah.

293
00:09:26,811 --> 00:09:30,010
So let's bring it all the way

294
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:31,290
to the beginning.

295
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,130
Like we are here talking

296
00:09:33,131 --> 00:09:34,730
about the Python community.

297
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:35,650
So I'm actually kind

298
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:37,450
of interested to know how you

299
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,250
actually started using Python.

300
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:39,610
Yeah.

301
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:42,450
So Python wasn't the first

302
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:44,090
language that I work with.

303
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,110
I started during my studies

304
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:49,390
in the late 2000s.

305
00:09:49,391 --> 00:09:50,390
They didn't really teach

306
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:51,750
Python at universities.

307
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:54,390
We studied C and C++ I believe.

308
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,230
And then I did my first Google Summer

309
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,910
of Code contributing gnome.

310
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:02,390
It was in C&GTK if I

311
00:10:02,391 --> 00:10:04,310
remember it was 2011.

312
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,550
And then I was also

313
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,590
very politically active at the time.

314
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,540
And I went, I was, it was time

315
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:14,660
for the second GSoC.

316
00:10:14,661 --> 00:10:16,620
And then I was okay, I want to do

317
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:18,500
something that's really specific

318
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:21,300
about citizen participation and

319
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:23,740
works really, really directly

320
00:10:23,741 --> 00:10:25,620
addresses, not indirectly as any

321
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:27,380
open source would, but directly

322
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:29,620
addresses a political issue.

323
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:31,780
And I found a small project

324
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:34,700
from Spain called e-cidadania.

325
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:35,500
I don't know if you pronounce

326
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:36,340
that right now, I am

327
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,130
in Spanish, but it was a citizen

328
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:42,290
participation platform.

329
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:42,970
Exactly.

330
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,970
And it was in the time it used

331
00:10:45,971 --> 00:10:49,850
Django and JavaScript to create this

332
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:52,250
little kanban like discussion,

333
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:54,330
if I can describe it now.

334
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:55,930
And it was supposed to be used by

335
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:57,810
the local government, if I remember

336
00:10:57,811 --> 00:11:00,490
right, to increase the participation

337
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:02,570
of the local people who live there.

338
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,530
And we worked on that.

339
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,050
It was really fun.

340
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:09,510
And then I think I just never

341
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:11,230
stopped working with Python

342
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,470
because I learned Django

343
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:13,830
and I felt so empowered.

344
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:15,790
I was, I can do anything now.

345
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,150
Yeah, because Django was, wow,

346
00:11:21,151 --> 00:11:22,230
these kind of frameworks

347
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:24,870
in 2012, 2013, I was like, I can

348
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:26,430
build any website I want.

349
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,590
And then I, then I also had

350
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:31,390
a job and a think tank.

351
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,470
I worked at a think tank

352
00:11:32,471 --> 00:11:33,350
as a software engineer.

353
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:35,590
I had a little team and we did

354
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:37,750
projects that were meant for,

355
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,030
to increase either awareness

356
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:41,430
or address social issues.

357
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:43,310
It was really still my favorite

358
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:44,550
job so many years after.

359
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,510
And this is.

360
00:11:46,511 --> 00:11:47,790
I could directly just use my

361
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,190
skills there and I felt just.

362
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,030
Yes.

363
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:52,950
And I still do Python.

364
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:54,830
That's very cool and I love that.

365
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:56,230
I think we need to

366
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:57,390
highlight that quote.

367
00:11:57,391 --> 00:11:59,030
Just now like, with Django,

368
00:11:59,031 --> 00:12:00,390
you feel so empowered.

369
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,550
I remember thinking

370
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:06,270
I can, I wanted to.

371
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,590
I can do everything now.

372
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,110
I know I, I'm a big fan

373
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:13,110
of the Django web framework myself.

374
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:14,790
That's what I also use

375
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:15,670
professionally.

376
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:15,990
So.

377
00:12:15,991 --> 00:12:17,110
And I totally agree.

378
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:21,750
Like, I mean right now I'm like

379
00:12:21,751 --> 00:12:23,270
I'm trying to replace all

380
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:25,110
my spreadsheets with Django.

381
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,910
I'm trying.

382
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,890
But yes, I love it at the end.

383
00:12:30,891 --> 00:12:32,650
It will be easier to edit eventually.

384
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,410
Yeah, yeah, I think.

385
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:35,890
Yeah, yeah.

386
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:39,330
So you know, It's Django

387
00:12:39,331 --> 00:12:41,570
in 2012 that was.

388
00:12:41,571 --> 00:12:43,810
I think it was like Django one point

389
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:46,370
something probably, or Django two.

390
00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:47,610
I don't know that it's

391
00:12:47,611 --> 00:12:48,930
a long time ago.

392
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:51,250
I wonder if you had encountered any

393
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,730
difficulties or other

394
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,690
limitations when working with

395
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,330
Django and Python back then.

396
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,620
So I think, people can.

397
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:01,500
It's archived now on GitHub, our

398
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:03,300
repository from then, but they can

399
00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:04,940
go and still see the type of commits

400
00:13:04,941 --> 00:13:07,380
and PRs that we did in the past.

401
00:13:07,381 --> 00:13:08,980
They're not what I would do now.

402
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:10,260
But I am not embarrassed

403
00:13:10,261 --> 00:13:11,220
from my beginnings.

404
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,860
They can check out how

405
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:15,140
we did Django then.

406
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:17,740
Yes, there were plenty of, growing

407
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:20,060
pains as somebody that only did

408
00:13:20,061 --> 00:13:22,420
C and C++ and thought in a very

409
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:24,310
different way about programming.

410
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:25,590
And I never did web before

411
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:26,630
in the, in the time.

412
00:13:26,631 --> 00:13:29,910
And it was all I had to start doing

413
00:13:29,911 --> 00:13:32,390
to apply for the GSoC.

414
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:33,750
I really, really wanted it.

415
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,870
And I was part of a hacker space

416
00:13:36,871 --> 00:13:39,110
for those few years already.

417
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:41,190
And it's lovely because when

418
00:13:41,191 --> 00:13:43,030
you're part of a hacker space

419
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,550
you have so many people

420
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:46,430
that are just there to hang out

421
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:49,270
and hack and code and mentor.

422
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:51,390
And there was a person called

423
00:13:51,391 --> 00:13:52,870
Vladan, which is shout out

424
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:55,030
to Vladan if he ever hears this.

425
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:58,130
And I remember that he was a great

426
00:13:58,131 --> 00:14:00,530
help to just push me to learn

427
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:02,090
and get this through this.

428
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,490
Growing pains faster.

429
00:14:03,491 --> 00:14:05,410
Yeah, I think there was a lot

430
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,850
in the, in the time that

431
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,570
it wasn't just learning Django,

432
00:14:09,571 --> 00:14:11,210
which maybe I don't know.

433
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:12,890
I think a big part of learning Django

434
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:14,290
is learning how the web works.

435
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,290
When you're beginning with Django,

436
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,090
I think, I knew theoretically

437
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,570
from my studies because we

438
00:14:20,571 --> 00:14:21,850
did networking and so on.

439
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:22,850
I have a Computer Science

440
00:14:22,851 --> 00:14:24,380
degree that I did before that.

441
00:14:24,381 --> 00:14:25,660
By the time I had it finished

442
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:27,460
by 2012, I was trying

443
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:28,820
to, I started the masters.

444
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,860
But yeah, I think, I think it

445
00:14:33,861 --> 00:14:35,780
was just so lovely and it was very

446
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:38,380
different from my C&GTK

447
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:40,340
experience the year before that.

448
00:14:40,341 --> 00:14:41,780
It was no going back,

449
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,860
but it wasn't, it wasn't fully

450
00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:45,900
straightforward, that's for sure.

451
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:46,900
It's just, it's hard for me

452
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:50,420
to remember was 13 years ago.

453
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,250
I remember somewhere, somehow

454
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:58,270
in one of my high school or

455
00:14:58,271 --> 00:15:01,410
polytechnic days we have basic

456
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:04,290
Computer Science and I learned C

457
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:06,130
there and I un-seen it.

458
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:12,690
Now I C and un-C.

459
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:17,160
Yeah, it was a lot.

460
00:15:17,161 --> 00:15:17,320
C.

461
00:15:17,321 --> 00:15:17,960
was a lot.

462
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:19,040
I think people still do it

463
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,440
now, I guess, but they are.

464
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:21,880
They do, they do, they do.

465
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,800
It's CPython.

466
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:25,080
Exactly.

467
00:15:25,081 --> 00:15:25,560
Yes.

468
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,200
When we built Python,

469
00:15:28,201 --> 00:15:29,160
it's still used.

470
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,840
But yeah, I also, I, I use Java and C#

471
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:36,440
before I learned Python,

472
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:38,920
but once I use Python, yeah, I'm.

473
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:41,080
This is the language I feel like

474
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:43,530
makes sense to me, you know, it's.

475
00:15:43,531 --> 00:15:45,170
Also, it's so versatile.

476
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:47,770
So in back then I did web and then

477
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:49,490
I did web for a few years and

478
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:53,450
then in 2015 I got a job where I

479
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:54,930
used Python to write hardware

480
00:15:54,931 --> 00:15:56,610
bindings, which was for music

481
00:15:56,611 --> 00:15:57,250
instrument.

482
00:15:57,251 --> 00:15:59,090
It was really fun.

483
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,370
And then I, then I transitioned

484
00:16:02,371 --> 00:16:04,930
to doing machine learning and NLP,

485
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,410
which one my degree is in.

486
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:08,590
So Python is very versatile.

487
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:10,550
It is, it's not just

488
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:11,830
Django that's empowering.

489
00:16:11,831 --> 00:16:13,350
It's like you have a language

490
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:14,750
that will take you through all

491
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:16,110
of this that you can

492
00:16:16,111 --> 00:16:17,790
lean back as a basis on.

493
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,550
I love that.

494
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:21,630
Can you talk more about your

495
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:23,630
involvement in the Python community?

496
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:25,230
Like how or.

497
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:27,790
I know you said you started using

498
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,310
Django and Python, but that's using

499
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:32,270
the language but then you become

500
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:33,550
involved in the community.

501
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:35,850
Can you talk more about that?

502
00:16:35,851 --> 00:16:36,570
Yes.

503
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:39,250
So, I guess by getting involved

504
00:16:39,251 --> 00:16:41,610
in Python as a community slightly

505
00:16:41,611 --> 00:16:43,410
related to my immigration because

506
00:16:43,411 --> 00:16:45,930
I come from a country

507
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:47,930
that's now called North Macedonia.

508
00:16:47,931 --> 00:16:48,930
Wasn't called like this

509
00:16:48,931 --> 00:16:49,770
where I lived there.

510
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,770
But so in there wasn't any

511
00:16:53,771 --> 00:16:55,210
separate Python community,

512
00:16:55,211 --> 00:16:56,730
although I already contributed

513
00:16:56,731 --> 00:16:58,970
open source-wise to Python.

514
00:16:58,971 --> 00:17:03,120
It was we were all one

515
00:17:03,121 --> 00:17:05,200
technical community so to say.

516
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:08,849
And since I was mostly I was tightly

517
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,960
intertwined with a Gno,me community

518
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:12,990
before went to their conferences.

519
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,880
I was involved in the pre-

520
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:18,589
Outreachy kind of groups.

521
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,280
And so on.

522
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,440
I did program in Python

523
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:24,720
but I never saw the community

524
00:17:24,721 --> 00:17:25,839
as a separate thing.

525
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,000
And when I immigrated or was trying

526
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:30,320
to immigrate to Berlin in 2013,

527
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,530
I get to know the PyLadies.

528
00:17:32,531 --> 00:17:33,690
The PyLadies.

529
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:35,210
This is one of the people,

530
00:17:35,211 --> 00:17:37,410
the first people that showed their

531
00:17:37,411 --> 00:17:39,050
welcome for me in the city.

532
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:41,610
So it's still my longest

533
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:42,930
standing relationship and I

534
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:44,010
really appreciate it.

535
00:17:44,011 --> 00:17:45,050
I don't think I would have

536
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:46,330
moved if they did not

537
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,500
were so welcoming to me.

538
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:49,930
There's Meili.

539
00:17:49,931 --> 00:17:51,050
I don't know if she's ever gonna

540
00:17:51,051 --> 00:17:52,810
hear this but she's still my friend

541
00:17:52,811 --> 00:17:54,730
and somehow I met her and she

542
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,370
invited me to give a talk about

543
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,180
all this political projects.

544
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,300
I did politically related projects

545
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:04,140
that were connected

546
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:05,700
to raising awareness or.

547
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:07,140
And they were all in Python

548
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,340
at the time.

549
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:09,660
As I said, empowered

550
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:10,180
to do everything.

551
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,820
And I remember doing that talk.

552
00:18:12,821 --> 00:18:13,780
I don't remember anymore.

553
00:18:13,781 --> 00:18:15,220
I cannot find any of the slides.

554
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,860
But I went.

555
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:19,820
I had to go back to where I was

556
00:18:19,821 --> 00:18:20,900
from because you cannot apply

557
00:18:20,901 --> 00:18:22,180
for a visa from Germany.

558
00:18:22,181 --> 00:18:24,660
And I had to figure all of that out.

559
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:27,350
And when I came back the community

560
00:18:27,351 --> 00:18:28,990
was there and that was really great.

561
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,910
And some of those people that I've

562
00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:32,190
met there are still some of my

563
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:34,070
closest friends where I'm here.

564
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,470
So Yeah.

565
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,670
I have never been truly organizing

566
00:18:40,671 --> 00:18:41,430
in the community

567
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:43,350
but I've given several talks.

568
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,110
My most recent one was in January.

569
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,950
I always go back when I have

570
00:18:49,951 --> 00:18:51,710
something new and what I really want

571
00:18:51,711 --> 00:18:54,200
to share with with the community.

572
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:57,080
And I, I mentor in sprints.

573
00:18:57,081 --> 00:18:59,360
I've mentored Django girls

574
00:18:59,361 --> 00:19:01,880
and similar kind of events.

575
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,880
Wherever there is help

576
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:05,160
needed of the sort.

577
00:19:05,161 --> 00:19:05,560
Yes.

578
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,360
So I guess in that way I do.

579
00:19:08,361 --> 00:19:10,080
Except well separate from

580
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:12,360
my open source work I did.

581
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:12,680
It's.

582
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:13,000
It's.

583
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:14,680
It's worth mentioning that during

584
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:18,160
the pandemic and when my, When I was

585
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:20,520
a very new mom, that was more rare.

586
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,920
I think I do a bit more now

587
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:24,280
than I did in those years.

588
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:25,760
Wow.

589
00:19:25,761 --> 00:19:26,360
But that.

590
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:29,080
That sounds a lot like you

591
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:30,760
are still pretty involved.

592
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:33,160
I mean right from the beginning till.

593
00:19:33,161 --> 00:19:35,960
Till what you are at right now

594
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:38,200
and like getting involved

595
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:40,760
in code, on the contribution,

596
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:42,680
that's quite a bit of time there.

597
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,360
And plus the community,

598
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:46,620
plus getting, sharing your.

599
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,660
Your knowledge to the community

600
00:19:49,661 --> 00:19:51,820
by giving talks and then

601
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,260
finally adding it to like providing

602
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:58,060
giving mentorship which is like wow.

603
00:19:58,061 --> 00:20:00,020
From zero to all the, all

604
00:20:00,021 --> 00:20:02,460
the level, from beginners all

605
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:04,060
the way to the expert

606
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:05,420
levels, you cover everything.

607
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,380
So thank you.

608
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:09,900
Yeah, I mean it's, it's really

609
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,390
amazing to see someone like you who

610
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:17,070
are so, so passionate about sharing

611
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:18,550
what you know to the community.

612
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,630
And I think because of people like

613
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,110
you, we get to learn more and we

614
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:25,710
get to understand a lot, a lot

615
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:29,280
more about how we can use the

616
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:31,110
different cases and how we can

617
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:33,590
actually learn literally when you

618
00:20:33,591 --> 00:20:34,470
mentor people.

619
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,110
So I'm actually very, very

620
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,710
interested to know like

621
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,080
how do you work on mentorship?

622
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:43,760
Because I recently had

623
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,440
very interesting conversation with

624
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,520
Djangonauts Space people and we are

625
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:52,800
talking about how we could actually

626
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,000
improve on mentorship.

627
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:57,560
So I would like to hear from

628
00:20:57,561 --> 00:20:58,760
your point of view, like,

629
00:20:58,761 --> 00:21:00,320
how do you actually started

630
00:21:00,321 --> 00:21:01,840
like mentoring people

631
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:03,920
and to get people to understand or

632
00:21:03,921 --> 00:21:05,040
to get people to learn?

633
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:06,480
Because people, when they

634
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:08,080
learn they come from all sorts

635
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:09,200
of all walks of life.

636
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,280
I think I have to mention something.

637
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,440
For me, mentorship is part

638
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:19,360
of my core values and it's related

639
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,280
to justice for me.

640
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,160
I come from a working class family

641
00:21:24,161 --> 00:21:26,560
that didn't have a lot of resources

642
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:27,600
and it was really hard

643
00:21:27,601 --> 00:21:29,600
for me to stay and get access

644
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:32,230
to more education programs.

645
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:34,310
Like the way my hackerspace friends

646
00:21:34,311 --> 00:21:35,910
helped me with those Google Summer

647
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:39,350
of Code projects, made me pay off my

648
00:21:39,351 --> 00:21:41,870
student loans that I had and I

649
00:21:41,871 --> 00:21:43,910
wouldn't be here without them.

650
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:48,070
And the effort I do for me is just

651
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:49,750
a way to keep this going,

652
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:52,070
taking people with me on the journey

653
00:21:52,071 --> 00:21:53,950
and it's never going to stop.

654
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:55,750
It's just part of my ethos,

655
00:21:55,751 --> 00:21:56,710
in a sense.

656
00:21:56,711 --> 00:21:58,030
So every time I show up, I show

657
00:21:58,031 --> 00:21:59,570
up with this in mind.

658
00:21:59,571 --> 00:22:00,570
So every time I get an idea

659
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:02,530
to talk at the PyLadies, it's.

660
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,810
I learned, I think in my last talk

661
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:08,600
I said that my company also does

662
00:22:08,601 --> 00:22:10,730
certification for Scikit Learn, so

663
00:22:10,731 --> 00:22:12,170
maybe people should check it out.

664
00:22:12,171 --> 00:22:13,530
It's, they're really doing

665
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:14,690
a great job with it.

666
00:22:14,691 --> 00:22:16,660
And there was an expert topic they

667
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,970
they mentioned and I was like, okay,

668
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:20,490
they mention it as an expert topic

669
00:22:20,491 --> 00:22:22,010
as part of the expert certification.

670
00:22:22,011 --> 00:22:23,890
I'm making a talk immediately

671
00:22:23,891 --> 00:22:25,530
to bring it to the PyLadies because

672
00:22:25,531 --> 00:22:27,940
I want these people to live the room

673
00:22:27,941 --> 00:22:30,340
feeling as experts in that night.

674
00:22:30,341 --> 00:22:32,420
So this is what guides me.

675
00:22:32,421 --> 00:22:33,860
What got me into this was this,

676
00:22:33,861 --> 00:22:35,020
of course, this experience with

677
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:38,020
the hackerspace which predates this

678
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:39,740
immigration experience and all

679
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:41,780
the more deep Python involvement.

680
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,380
And also I gained some skill by being

681
00:22:45,381 --> 00:22:48,580
a TA at the university. My first

682
00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:50,980
degree, that was a really long time.

683
00:22:50,981 --> 00:22:52,900
I think their skills were refined.

684
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:54,100
I have a very different

685
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:55,770
approach now than I had when I was

686
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,680
a child at university,

687
00:22:57,681 --> 00:22:59,920
so to say, a young person.

688
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:00,280
Yeah.

689
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:01,560
And for the, how do

690
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:02,920
we, how do we mentor.

691
00:23:02,921 --> 00:23:05,400
I think there as open source in

692
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:07,160
open source contribution sprints or

693
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:08,520
for people to get involved.

694
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:10,800
There is a specific, I do have very

695
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,080
specific ideas there that I'm

696
00:23:13,081 --> 00:23:14,960
trying now as a first, I'm a, I've

697
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:16,240
been involved for so long, but I've

698
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:18,440
never been a maintainer and I've

699
00:23:18,441 --> 00:23:20,360
even had keynotes to talk to other

700
00:23:20,361 --> 00:23:20,560
people.

701
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:21,970
I never had the chance

702
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:23,610
to any, to implement anything

703
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:24,490
of what I've been saying.

704
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:25,610
I could only hope that other

705
00:23:25,611 --> 00:23:27,290
people would implement it.

706
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:30,290
And now I'm trying to pour into

707
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:34,410
the project as much as I can and it

708
00:23:34,411 --> 00:23:36,170
shows in the way we do our sprints

709
00:23:36,171 --> 00:23:38,010
and the way we try to retain people.

710
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,250
Some things for me that

711
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,810
are really, really important are

712
00:23:42,811 --> 00:23:45,490
structure and process and a focus

713
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,690
on continuous involvement.

714
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,740
And I'm really trying to work

715
00:23:50,741 --> 00:23:52,940
on these aspects at the moment.

716
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:54,500
So not just getting people in, we

717
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:56,260
can do a sprint, but we want people

718
00:23:56,261 --> 00:23:57,620
to stay and work with us.

719
00:23:57,621 --> 00:24:00,380
We want them to feel nice and welcome

720
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:05,100
and necessary and useful and to

721
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:07,660
take this knowledge out as well

722
00:24:07,661 --> 00:24:09,100
out in their other projects.

723
00:24:09,101 --> 00:24:12,220
Could you share some examples of

724
00:24:12,221 --> 00:24:14,420
how you plan to implement this?

725
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:15,700
Like I know you mentioned you have

726
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:18,610
some ideas and you felt like

727
00:24:18,611 --> 00:24:20,610
because you weren't a maintainer

728
00:24:20,611 --> 00:24:22,370
you couldn't implement this.

729
00:24:22,371 --> 00:24:25,250
And that's an interesting topic.

730
00:24:25,251 --> 00:24:26,410
Maybe I'll ask about it

731
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:27,130
a little bit later.

732
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:29,450
But now you have these ideas.

733
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:30,770
Can you share a little bit,

734
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,490
a snippet of what it is?

735
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:35,050
Yeah, I think for different projects

736
00:24:35,051 --> 00:24:36,850
it will mean a different thing.

737
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:38,650
So for example, things that

738
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:39,650
I've worked on recently

739
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,050
that turned out to be great.

740
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,760
I just.

741
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:44,560
When was it?

742
00:24:44,561 --> 00:24:45,840
It was three weeks ago.

743
00:24:45,841 --> 00:24:47,600
Two weeks ago we had a sprint.

744
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:48,800
And I.

745
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:50,199
That's very recent.

746
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,280
but it wasn't

747
00:24:54,281 --> 00:24:55,520
the only sprint recently.

748
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:58,080
So I spent two weeks before

749
00:24:58,081 --> 00:24:59,440
the sprint digging up,

750
00:24:59,441 --> 00:25:01,440
first issues that were.

751
00:25:01,441 --> 00:25:02,840
There was a gradation there

752
00:25:02,841 --> 00:25:04,360
but they were all separate,

753
00:25:04,361 --> 00:25:05,440
not part of a giant one.

754
00:25:05,441 --> 00:25:07,360
They didn't involve so much thinking,

755
00:25:07,361 --> 00:25:08,800
but they were perfect for teaching

756
00:25:08,801 --> 00:25:12,310
the process and making closing.

757
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:14,190
So making a PR that can be

758
00:25:14,191 --> 00:25:15,550
also merged really quickly.

759
00:25:15,551 --> 00:25:17,230
So everybody that participated in

760
00:25:17,231 --> 00:25:19,350
the sprint made a PR by the end of

761
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,510
it and everybody was really happy.

762
00:25:21,511 --> 00:25:22,870
So we don't know how many of these

763
00:25:22,871 --> 00:25:24,590
people are going to stay but for

764
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:27,230
example, in our Discord channel, I

765
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:28,830
constantly post whenever there is

766
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:31,430
a new issue, how difficult it is.

767
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,830
I offer help for people to continue.

768
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,210
And we had, for example

769
00:25:37,211 --> 00:25:38,770
from the PyLadiesCon,

770
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:40,690
we had a person that joined.

771
00:25:40,691 --> 00:25:44,050
I was just me online, there not.

772
00:25:44,051 --> 00:25:44,930
It was not in person.

773
00:25:44,931 --> 00:25:45,130
Right.

774
00:25:45,131 --> 00:25:46,970
It was an online conference and we

775
00:25:46,971 --> 00:25:49,250
had a person that did heard about

776
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:51,770
the project, but didn't really have

777
00:25:51,771 --> 00:25:53,210
time to participate and now is still

778
00:25:53,211 --> 00:25:54,930
one of our most active contributors.

779
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,930
Yes, shout out to Neha.

780
00:25:58,931 --> 00:25:59,970
Yes, she's lovely.

781
00:25:59,971 --> 00:26:03,490
And for example, right now she

782
00:26:03,491 --> 00:26:04,930
is interested in helping with

783
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:05,970
some of the project management

784
00:26:05,971 --> 00:26:07,330
efforts that we're doing.

785
00:26:07,331 --> 00:26:09,490
And it's really cool.

786
00:26:09,491 --> 00:26:11,650
We have an issue together at a link.

787
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,930
She has been a collaborator

788
00:26:13,931 --> 00:26:16,290
to redo all the documentation

789
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:17,570
for newcomers as well.

790
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,370
The perspective of people

791
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:20,670
new to projects,

792
00:26:20,671 --> 00:26:22,050
is really, really valuable.

793
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,050
And right now I think

794
00:26:24,051 --> 00:26:25,210
this is the biggest project

795
00:26:25,211 --> 00:26:26,370
that I want to do.

796
00:26:26,371 --> 00:26:28,050
We seem to be attracting

797
00:26:28,051 --> 00:26:29,290
and people are really happy

798
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:31,370
at the sprints, but there is a bit

799
00:26:31,371 --> 00:26:32,570
of a structure and process

800
00:26:32,571 --> 00:26:35,130
lacking for them staying.

801
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,650
And although we have a lot

802
00:26:37,651 --> 00:26:39,050
of downloads, as I mentioned,

803
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:40,410
the project is really small.

804
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,580
There are not a lot of maintainers,

805
00:26:43,581 --> 00:26:45,290
that are very active or just.

806
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:46,890
It's just a small project.

807
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:48,490
It's okay as it is for just

808
00:26:48,491 --> 00:26:50,610
the maintenance, but for growing or

809
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:53,650
for including people, we need to do

810
00:26:53,651 --> 00:26:55,690
a little bit more and we want to.

811
00:26:55,691 --> 00:26:57,690
So right now I'm having an initiative

812
00:26:57,691 --> 00:27:00,100
to organize things in

813
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:01,740
little groups so people, when they

814
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:03,620
come into the project can be

815
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,980
interested in a specific group.

816
00:27:05,981 --> 00:27:07,380
So to say it doesn't have.

817
00:27:07,381 --> 00:27:08,740
They mean they can also build

818
00:27:08,741 --> 00:27:10,420
expertise and be an expert person

819
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:11,380
in the documentation.

820
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:12,420
That is awesome.

821
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:13,900
But it needs to be presented

822
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:15,700
in a way that it shows a path.

823
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:16,860
We don't have that right now.

824
00:27:16,861 --> 00:27:18,220
I think a lot of big projects

825
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:19,380
definitely have this.

826
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,380
That's why I say it's dependent

827
00:27:21,381 --> 00:27:23,900
on the project or things like, other

828
00:27:23,901 --> 00:27:25,740
types of improvements because it's.

829
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:26,980
People come to a project like,

830
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:28,380
okay, I'm going to contribute,

831
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:29,980
let's do this, a little bit of that.

832
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,860
But a big Python code base

833
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:35,220
doesn't have just one type of thing.

834
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:35,700
I've been.

835
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:37,020
Most of the things I've been

836
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:39,180
contributing for this last month

837
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:40,780
have been Scikit Learn, cross

838
00:27:40,781 --> 00:27:42,500
compatibility because I also

839
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:43,620
work with Scikit Learn and

840
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:45,820
improving Fairlearn to be

841
00:27:45,821 --> 00:27:47,620
seamlessly used in the Scikit

842
00:27:47,621 --> 00:27:49,100
Learn pipelines and so on.

843
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,690
And this is just one type of thing.

844
00:27:51,691 --> 00:27:52,810
You don't have to be an expert

845
00:27:52,811 --> 00:27:54,730
in anything and I want to make this

846
00:27:54,731 --> 00:27:57,730
explicit by, by categorizing thing

847
00:27:57,731 --> 00:27:59,730
so people can find their own niche

848
00:27:59,731 --> 00:28:01,650
and feel confident in it.

849
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:03,810
So not just oh the for example

850
00:28:03,811 --> 00:28:06,670
the FairLearns methods are really

851
00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:08,530
quite a bit of advanced knowledge

852
00:28:08,531 --> 00:28:11,570
in maths or statistics and this

853
00:28:11,571 --> 00:28:12,930
can be very intimidating.

854
00:28:12,931 --> 00:28:14,650
Somebody joined the PyLadiesCon

855
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,450
and told me that they felt

856
00:28:16,451 --> 00:28:17,910
more intimidating contributing

857
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,770
to the Fairlearn compares than

858
00:28:19,771 --> 00:28:21,700
the Python core which then

859
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,780
I felt okay, we need to, yes.

860
00:28:23,781 --> 00:28:24,500
Fix this.

861
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,020
I think some of our

862
00:28:27,021 --> 00:28:28,930
methods look very cryptic.

863
00:28:28,931 --> 00:28:29,300
We need.

864
00:28:29,301 --> 00:28:30,660
And we are definitely

865
00:28:30,661 --> 00:28:32,260
working on fixing it.

866
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,050
So this is one of the efforts.

867
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:35,940
Yeah, so that's what I mean.

868
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:36,420
You don't need

869
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:37,540
to understand this math.

870
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:38,780
There's so many other places

871
00:28:38,781 --> 00:28:40,900
you could be essential.

872
00:28:40,901 --> 00:28:41,860
There's just so much

873
00:28:41,861 --> 00:28:42,940
work always to be done.

874
00:28:42,941 --> 00:28:44,580
But it's not explicit and we're

875
00:28:44,581 --> 00:28:45,740
not showing people gradation

876
00:28:45,741 --> 00:28:47,250
how they build the skills.

877
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:49,810
There's also a lot of, volunteer

878
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:53,410
time is precious and you

879
00:28:53,411 --> 00:28:55,250
know maintainers need to support

880
00:28:55,251 --> 00:28:56,290
like as a maintener,

881
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:57,330
Easy for me to get lost

882
00:28:57,331 --> 00:28:59,690
in my little technical hole so

883
00:28:59,691 --> 00:29:01,810
to say digging endlessly.

884
00:29:01,811 --> 00:29:03,409
But I think I'm more useful.

885
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,690
unblocking others

886
00:29:04,691 --> 00:29:06,410
and supporting the project to stay.

887
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,210
So this is my, I'm doing the more

888
00:29:08,211 --> 00:29:10,050
grunty work myself because I want

889
00:29:10,051 --> 00:29:12,130
others to you know do this kinds

890
00:29:12,131 --> 00:29:13,650
of things for our project.

891
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:14,570
This, we don't have any

892
00:29:14,571 --> 00:29:16,830
of this but I, I've been involved

893
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:17,910
in projects like Gnome

894
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:19,230
which are my inspiration.

895
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:19,990
I have to say I don't know

896
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:20,870
how it is right now.

897
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,110
I have not been contributing

898
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:25,030
for such a long time and they

899
00:29:25,031 --> 00:29:26,790
had such strong organization

900
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,350
where you could feel that

901
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:33,430
every contribution is really valued.

902
00:29:33,431 --> 00:29:34,950
Every type of contribution.

903
00:29:34,951 --> 00:29:35,910
That's something

904
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:37,070
that we have lacking a

905
00:29:37,071 --> 00:29:39,350
little bit still the code,

906
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,940
a few appreciators.

907
00:29:41,941 --> 00:29:42,140
Yeah.

908
00:29:42,141 --> 00:29:43,620
But also every type, not just

909
00:29:43,621 --> 00:29:45,580
the programming and specific type

910
00:29:45,581 --> 00:29:47,620
of programming being celebrated.

911
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:48,100
Yeah.

912
00:29:48,101 --> 00:29:48,900
Because everything

913
00:29:48,901 --> 00:29:50,260
is really valuable.

914
00:29:50,261 --> 00:29:51,940
It's true, it's true.

915
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:52,820
Yeah.

916
00:29:52,821 --> 00:29:54,620
I feel like the fact that

917
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:55,780
you phrase it that way.

918
00:29:55,781 --> 00:29:57,739
I do feel that there is

919
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,860
this, how do I say it?

920
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:02,180
Like appearance like that

921
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,260
code contribution is

922
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:07,540
being celebrated more compared to

923
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:09,300
other kind of contribution.

924
00:30:09,301 --> 00:30:11,300
Like it's hard to.

925
00:30:11,301 --> 00:30:11,660
Yeah.

926
00:30:11,661 --> 00:30:12,740
I don't know how to address that

927
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,300
I mean every contribution counts

928
00:30:16,301 --> 00:30:18,620
because yeah Open source

929
00:30:18,621 --> 00:30:20,900
doesn't mean it's zero effort.

930
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,860
Anything that anyone volunteers

931
00:30:24,861 --> 00:30:27,460
to do something, it matters.

932
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:28,020
Absolutely.

933
00:30:28,021 --> 00:30:29,380
But I don't think that people feel

934
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:31,260
this sometimes in the projects where

935
00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:33,380
they work as somebody that has been

936
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:35,060
mostly contributing code to project

937
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,020
and wanted to do other things.

938
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:39,180
I could see the stark difference when

939
00:30:39,181 --> 00:30:40,500
I would be in the different types

940
00:30:40,501 --> 00:30:42,260
of contributing and also when I did, for

941
00:30:42,261 --> 00:30:43,620
example, I did several jobs where

942
00:30:43,621 --> 00:30:45,620
I had developer relations jobs.

943
00:30:45,621 --> 00:30:46,700
And you could feel also

944
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:49,620
the difference there, how you're

945
00:30:49,621 --> 00:30:50,380
perceived and how your

946
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:52,060
contributions are perceived.

947
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,060
I think this is a mindset, but it has

948
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,420
to come from the maintainers.

949
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:57,420
This true.

950
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,780
There's also a very common

951
00:31:00,781 --> 00:31:02,590
discussion point that we talk

952
00:31:02,591 --> 00:31:06,150
about is that a lot of people,

953
00:31:06,151 --> 00:31:08,190
when they start sprints, it's

954
00:31:08,191 --> 00:31:12,870
really hard, like to prepare for

955
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,190
the new contributors because

956
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,950
sometimes a lot of maintainers,

957
00:31:18,951 --> 00:31:20,710
like you said, you're already

958
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:23,110
really deep into your project.

959
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:25,910
So your mindset is.

960
00:31:25,911 --> 00:31:27,110
I already know that.

961
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,840
So some of the people who are new,

962
00:31:29,841 --> 00:31:32,680
they get to like confused like

963
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:34,840
even the very basic on how to start

964
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:36,320
and how to get things going.

965
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,720
So like say, for example,

966
00:31:38,721 --> 00:31:40,200
if there's one person coming

967
00:31:40,201 --> 00:31:41,440
to join, it's easy.

968
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:42,800
What if like there's 10?

969
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,880
How do you prepare to get so

970
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:47,840
many different people to start?

971
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,000
So I wonder if you have a specific

972
00:31:52,001 --> 00:31:53,970
idea how you manage that.

973
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,810
So for this particular sprint, I had

974
00:31:56,811 --> 00:32:00,850
10 people and I was from my project.

975
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,570
I do had some help

976
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:05,330
from the second, people.

977
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,010
It was lovely.

978
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:09,450
I honestly, I think there's nothing

979
00:32:09,451 --> 00:32:11,090
that fulfills me more than a group

980
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:13,250
of people, getting to know

981
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:15,690
and starting and seeing them glow by

982
00:32:15,691 --> 00:32:17,090
the end because they've made a PR.

983
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,170
I.

984
00:32:18,171 --> 00:32:18,530
That's.

985
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:19,420
It's just the most

986
00:32:19,421 --> 00:32:20,820
fulfilling thing ever.

987
00:32:20,821 --> 00:32:22,620
So I, So how we prepared.

988
00:32:22,621 --> 00:32:25,420
There is an issue in Fairlearn, if

989
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:26,940
anybody's interested, that I started

990
00:32:26,941 --> 00:32:28,740
to prepare for the sprint.

991
00:32:28,741 --> 00:32:29,940
I did it with Neha.

992
00:32:29,941 --> 00:32:30,780
Neha is great.

993
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:32,060
Thank you, Neha very much.

994
00:32:32,061 --> 00:32:34,020
My main collaborator on the issue.

995
00:32:34,021 --> 00:32:35,460
We did several points.

996
00:32:35,461 --> 00:32:36,340
One of them we still

997
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:37,620
haven't fulfilled.

998
00:32:37,621 --> 00:32:39,060
And for example, we went through

999
00:32:39,061 --> 00:32:42,460
all the documentation and Neha had

1000
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,340
ideas and rewrote some of it.

1001
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,820
For example, we didn't have a step

1002
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:48,220
explaining how to do a virtual

1003
00:32:48,221 --> 00:32:49,540
environment because this is just.

1004
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:49,740
I.

1005
00:32:49,741 --> 00:32:51,040
Sometimes I just don't

1006
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:52,080
think about it.

1007
00:32:52,081 --> 00:32:52,840
But it's.

1008
00:32:52,841 --> 00:32:53,760
Yeah, it's something

1009
00:32:53,761 --> 00:32:54,960
that we should do.

1010
00:32:54,961 --> 00:32:56,360
So we added these kinds of things.

1011
00:32:56,361 --> 00:32:57,920
We redid some language, added

1012
00:32:57,921 --> 00:32:59,560
some more links, added Code

1013
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,000
of Conduct everywhere because we

1014
00:33:01,001 --> 00:33:02,640
didn't have it in enough places.

1015
00:33:02,641 --> 00:33:04,560
We redid the readme so it's

1016
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:05,920
more easier for people to

1017
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,480
just jump on different places.

1018
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,560
What else?

1019
00:33:09,561 --> 00:33:10,800
There's more things that we did,

1020
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:12,880
I don't remember.

1021
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,560
The only thing we didn't

1022
00:33:14,561 --> 00:33:15,960
do was Create videos for

1023
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:17,310
people to watch at home.

1024
00:33:17,311 --> 00:33:18,270
That is coming next.

1025
00:33:18,271 --> 00:33:19,710
I have a person that volunteered

1026
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:20,630
to do it for Windows.

1027
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,110
I don't have a Windows machine

1028
00:33:22,111 --> 00:33:24,190
and I will do it for MacOS.

1029
00:33:24,191 --> 00:33:24,750
And I.

1030
00:33:24,751 --> 00:33:27,230
And the main thing I did myself was

1031
00:33:27,231 --> 00:33:28,750
digging out just the right

1032
00:33:28,751 --> 00:33:30,550
type of issues because I did

1033
00:33:30,551 --> 00:33:31,750
study a bit of cognitive science

1034
00:33:31,751 --> 00:33:33,390
and early childhood development

1035
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:35,710
and language and so on.

1036
00:33:35,711 --> 00:33:38,270
And one of the interests, biggest

1037
00:33:38,271 --> 00:33:39,830
interests that I have is learning

1038
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:42,110
and learning itself for the brain.

1039
00:33:42,111 --> 00:33:45,830
And one of the biggest problems

1040
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:47,590
with language learning for example

1041
00:33:47,591 --> 00:33:50,510
is the gap from B1 level

1042
00:33:50,511 --> 00:33:52,910
to like getting the next levels.

1043
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:54,070
And this is because

1044
00:33:54,071 --> 00:33:56,550
the gradation of tasks disappears.

1045
00:33:56,551 --> 00:33:57,870
For somebody to be challenged

1046
00:33:57,871 --> 00:33:59,150
but not overwhelmed and quit.

1047
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:00,590
You need the right type of task.

1048
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:01,990
It needs to be not too hard

1049
00:34:01,991 --> 00:34:03,430
and not too easy.

1050
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:05,110
And this is how you

1051
00:34:05,111 --> 00:34:06,110
go to the next level.

1052
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:08,270
And this is the same type of thinking

1053
00:34:08,271 --> 00:34:09,630
has to be applied to an issue.

1054
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,949
For a Sprint, for example, if it's

1055
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,350
the documentation works,

1056
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:14,750
they're not big hiccups.

1057
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:17,350
There's the issue itself is teaching

1058
00:34:17,351 --> 00:34:19,870
you the flow does not require

1059
00:34:19,871 --> 00:34:22,030
an immense amount of digging.

1060
00:34:22,031 --> 00:34:22,949
It's just loud.

1061
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:23,870
There are so many people.

1062
00:34:23,871 --> 00:34:25,710
So somebody can do this semi

1063
00:34:25,711 --> 00:34:27,030
independently after you have

1064
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:28,510
unblocked them in some way.

1065
00:34:28,511 --> 00:34:29,469
That is a really good,

1066
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,510
good first issue.

1067
00:34:30,511 --> 00:34:31,510
There could be a follow

1068
00:34:31,511 --> 00:34:32,710
up but the first issue

1069
00:34:32,711 --> 00:34:34,030
should be really easy.

1070
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:35,190
It is a very hard thing

1071
00:34:35,191 --> 00:34:36,590
for projects too.

1072
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:38,699
I hit them for good first issues.

1073
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,179
Labels.

1074
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,659
I put them under reserved

1075
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,300
for Sprint for two weeks.

1076
00:34:42,301 --> 00:34:43,420
So they were not available

1077
00:34:43,421 --> 00:34:44,540
for the general public.

1078
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:45,179
This is.

1079
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,020
Yes, that will happen

1080
00:34:47,021 --> 00:34:48,060
every single time.

1081
00:34:48,061 --> 00:34:49,500
But yeah, we had some, some

1082
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:50,780
for the, for the public.

1083
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:52,699
I see that you're contributing

1084
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,659
everywhere and things like that.

1085
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,020
Like other than that, aside from

1086
00:34:57,021 --> 00:35:01,020
code and community, do you do any

1087
00:35:01,021 --> 00:35:03,350
other things like do you

1088
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,190
have any personal interest or.

1089
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:08,830
Yes, I guess I spend most

1090
00:35:08,831 --> 00:35:11,630
of my times when I'm not working or

1091
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:12,990
doing work related things or

1092
00:35:12,991 --> 00:35:14,710
community things with my son.

1093
00:35:14,711 --> 00:35:16,280
I have a child, he's

1094
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,070
gonna be seven soon.

1095
00:35:18,071 --> 00:35:19,070
Well very soon.

1096
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:20,350
It's probably my favorite part

1097
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,310
of the day most of the time.

1098
00:35:22,311 --> 00:35:22,790
Yes.

1099
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,070
I also have a little blog or

1100
00:35:27,071 --> 00:35:28,670
a substack, however they call this

1101
00:35:28,671 --> 00:35:30,070
thing newsletter these days.

1102
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,800
I moved my blog there and I

1103
00:35:32,801 --> 00:35:34,680
write about language, technology

1104
00:35:34,681 --> 00:35:37,240
and society which

1105
00:35:37,241 --> 00:35:38,600
are my main interests.

1106
00:35:38,601 --> 00:35:40,200
I don't write very often but if

1107
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:41,800
people want to hear me talk about

1108
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:44,360
these things they could subscribe.

1109
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,280
Yes, I love to read and I love

1110
00:35:48,281 --> 00:35:49,800
literature and everything.

1111
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,760
Literature again ties to my love

1112
00:35:51,761 --> 00:35:53,240
for language I have to say.

1113
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:54,120
And I do take care

1114
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:55,480
of a lot of plants.

1115
00:35:55,481 --> 00:35:55,880
Cool.

1116
00:35:55,881 --> 00:35:58,760
At the moment that's like a lot of

1117
00:35:58,761 --> 00:36:01,040
things that you, you're organizing.

1118
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:01,440
Right?

1119
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,480
Those are the recharging things.

1120
00:36:04,481 --> 00:36:07,480
Those my, my child and my books

1121
00:36:07,481 --> 00:36:09,600
and my thoughts about

1122
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,000
language and, and society are

1123
00:36:13,001 --> 00:36:15,360
just, it's where I, I, I draw energy

1124
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:17,360
from and sprints as I said.

1125
00:36:17,361 --> 00:36:18,000
I don't know.

1126
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,640
That sounds like de-charging for me.

1127
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,240
It's recharging for you.

1128
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,200
So.

1129
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,520
So with so many things that you have

1130
00:36:34,521 --> 00:36:37,240
in your mind, what is your plan like

1131
00:36:37,241 --> 00:36:39,520
you, that you want to work next?

1132
00:36:39,521 --> 00:36:41,440
Because it seems like you have some,

1133
00:36:41,441 --> 00:36:44,240
quite a lot of things going on like

1134
00:36:44,241 --> 00:36:46,080
the plans that you have in future.

1135
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,200
I think in thinking about it

1136
00:36:49,201 --> 00:36:50,560
a lot personally as well.

1137
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,390
I've spent the last 15 years

1138
00:36:53,391 --> 00:36:56,110
really guided by curiosity

1139
00:36:56,111 --> 00:36:59,710
and a giant desire for technical

1140
00:36:59,711 --> 00:37:01,710
newness and depth and just

1141
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,350
creativity of that kind.

1142
00:37:04,351 --> 00:37:05,990
And these days, especially this

1143
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:09,710
year, I realized that more and more

1144
00:37:09,711 --> 00:37:12,110
I get fulfilled by unblocking

1145
00:37:12,111 --> 00:37:13,910
others and growing others and

1146
00:37:13,911 --> 00:37:15,870
helping fostering environments

1147
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:18,190
where things can involve as many

1148
00:37:18,191 --> 00:37:18,990
people as possible.

1149
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,450
So I think in the next few years I

1150
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:22,810
want to think and implement

1151
00:37:22,811 --> 00:37:24,290
initiatives in the projects I'm

1152
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:26,810
involved in or as my day to day

1153
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:29,410
job where I can uplift others and

1154
00:37:29,411 --> 00:37:31,490
empower and support and unblock

1155
00:37:31,491 --> 00:37:31,930
people.

1156
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:34,090
I think that is, that's my

1157
00:37:34,091 --> 00:37:35,610
main focus at the moment,

1158
00:37:35,611 --> 00:37:37,010
or I would like it to be.

1159
00:37:37,011 --> 00:37:39,210
I'm still a software engineer

1160
00:37:39,211 --> 00:37:40,490
mostly at the time.

1161
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:44,290
Still the idea of giving back, giving

1162
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:46,560
back, like what you learn, you're

1163
00:37:46,561 --> 00:37:48,360
just, it just sounds so generous.

1164
00:37:48,361 --> 00:37:49,920
Like whatever you learn, you

1165
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:51,160
just want to share and let

1166
00:37:51,161 --> 00:37:52,600
everyone know what you learn.

1167
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:54,360
I mean I've been loved and helped.

1168
00:37:54,361 --> 00:37:54,920
Right.

1169
00:37:54,921 --> 00:37:56,680
It's only just to

1170
00:37:56,681 --> 00:37:57,960
continuously give back.

1171
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,240
Wow.

1172
00:37:59,241 --> 00:38:02,000
We need 200 Tamaras out

1173
00:38:02,001 --> 00:38:03,400
there and the community

1174
00:38:03,401 --> 00:38:04,920
thrives immediately.

1175
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,180
I think when I look at my friend,

1176
00:38:08,181 --> 00:38:09,480
Jessica Greene for example,

1177
00:38:09,481 --> 00:38:11,240
you must know Jessica Greene.

1178
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:14,090
There is one at least that I

1179
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:16,010
know that my friend Meili and all

1180
00:38:16,011 --> 00:38:17,050
of these other people

1181
00:38:17,051 --> 00:38:18,370
that I'm in touch, they're just

1182
00:38:18,371 --> 00:38:19,530
really, really generous.

1183
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:20,770
They've been generous with me

1184
00:38:20,771 --> 00:38:22,610
and I want to be generous with

1185
00:38:22,611 --> 00:38:24,610
the world too as, as much as I can.

1186
00:38:24,611 --> 00:38:25,970
You know, we have seasons

1187
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:27,570
in life where we can't and seasons

1188
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,250
in life where we can definitely.

1189
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:30,810
This is one of, this is one of those.

1190
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:32,410
We don't know how long they last.

1191
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:33,570
So true.

1192
00:38:33,571 --> 00:38:33,970
Yeah.

1193
00:38:33,971 --> 00:38:36,370
Well we have to, I mean

1194
00:38:36,371 --> 00:38:37,970
to represent the community.

1195
00:38:37,971 --> 00:38:39,850
I want to say thank you because this

1196
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,860
is like really something that we

1197
00:38:42,861 --> 00:38:45,660
need to celebrate and thank people

1198
00:38:45,661 --> 00:38:48,180
like you who contribute so much and

1199
00:38:48,181 --> 00:38:51,460
to, to put in so much time and even

1200
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:54,460
plan you are even thinking like,

1201
00:38:54,461 --> 00:38:56,460
what am I gonna do next to make it

1202
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:57,140
better?

1203
00:38:57,141 --> 00:38:59,540
That's like, wow, crazy.

1204
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:00,100
Thank you.

1205
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:01,380
There's really no need.

1206
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,460
Definitely.

1207
00:39:03,461 --> 00:39:04,420
I don't know.

1208
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:05,620
There are so many people that

1209
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:07,500
do way more, that's for sure.

1210
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:08,300
The new here.

1211
00:39:08,301 --> 00:39:09,620
I mean, this is, this

1212
00:39:09,621 --> 00:39:10,860
is a lot of work.

1213
00:39:10,861 --> 00:39:12,940
So if, is there anything that

1214
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:14,380
you, would like to share before

1215
00:39:14,381 --> 00:39:16,740
we close, this podcast episode?

1216
00:39:16,741 --> 00:39:18,780
Like, you like to share with our

1217
00:39:18,781 --> 00:39:21,900
audience on something that you

1218
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,740
would want to give a shout out to?

1219
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:25,820
Before we could end this episode, I.

1220
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:26,940
Think it would be nice if people

1221
00:39:26,941 --> 00:39:29,340
try Fairlearn, give us,

1222
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,700
an idea what they could use it for.

1223
00:39:32,701 --> 00:39:34,940
And we always have good first issues.

1224
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,710
They can come work with us.

1225
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:38,030
We have a Discord community

1226
00:39:38,031 --> 00:39:39,110
when we're always available.

1227
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:40,430
And I'm always happy to help

1228
00:39:40,431 --> 00:39:42,550
people come into the community.

1229
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:44,590
So I guess an open invite to anyone

1230
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:45,830
that wants to join the project

1231
00:39:45,831 --> 00:39:48,550
in some way and help with AI

1232
00:39:48,551 --> 00:39:50,870
safety and algorithmic fairness.

1233
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:53,310
So perhaps, you could also give us,

1234
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,390
where they could reach out

1235
00:39:55,391 --> 00:39:57,430
to you if they would want to

1236
00:39:57,431 --> 00:39:59,030
reach out to you for mentorship.

1237
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,080
I am on the PyLadies Slack channel,

1238
00:40:02,081 --> 00:40:04,120
but if they're not a PyLady

1239
00:40:04,121 --> 00:40:05,880
I only have a LinkedIn account.

1240
00:40:05,881 --> 00:40:09,000
I don't have any other social, media.

1241
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:09,480
Okay.

1242
00:40:09,481 --> 00:40:11,320
And, I don't know if Substack

1243
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:12,480
has some kind of feature

1244
00:40:12,481 --> 00:40:15,400
to talk to people, but, I think

1245
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:16,520
LinkedIn is probably better

1246
00:40:16,521 --> 00:40:17,559
because I don't, I don't know

1247
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,760
the answer to that question.

1248
00:40:18,761 --> 00:40:19,500
Okay.

1249
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:20,880
You can see my last name,

1250
00:40:20,881 --> 00:40:22,520
I guess in the recording

1251
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:23,640
and then you can find me.

1252
00:40:23,641 --> 00:40:24,760
And I'm happy to accept

1253
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:26,280
anyone that sends a request.

1254
00:40:26,281 --> 00:40:26,760
Of course.

1255
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:28,370
Sounds good.

1256
00:40:28,371 --> 00:40:29,680
So thank you very much,

1257
00:40:29,681 --> 00:40:31,330
Tamara, for your time taken.

1258
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,370
It's still like, I'm still so

1259
00:40:35,371 --> 00:40:37,570
amazed by so much that you

1260
00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:39,250
have done over the years.

1261
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:42,690
You can compile

1262
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:43,970
and probably it's like.

1263
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:47,970
It'S been many years.

1264
00:40:47,971 --> 00:40:49,170
There was time.

1265
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:50,930
Yes.

1266
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:54,090

1267
00:40:54,091 --> 00:40:56,930
can actually find us on, pypodcats.
