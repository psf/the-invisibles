1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,700
uh

2
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,700
I forgot how we start

3
00:00:02,166 --> 00:00:05,133
Okay Hi everybody and welcome to the PyPodcast

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,000
Hidden Figures in Python figure

5
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:11,000
we are continuing with our scissor see

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,766
Hi everybody and welcome to the PyPodcast

7
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,666
so yeah today's guest err today's host

8
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:21,266
oh my God this is a blooper

9
00:00:27,266 --> 00:00:28,866
like wrangling volunteers is hard

10
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:30,866
there's a lot of just like management challenges

11
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:32,600
a lot of the time when people think of Africa

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,633
they think of it as like

13
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,866
just like a blob and everything's the same

14
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:37,100
and it's really not like

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,633
there are very big cultural differences

16
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:40,366
between different African countries

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,300
when did you get started with Python?

18
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:45,633
so I got started um when I was in university

19
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:49,433
I was coding for food I needed money and um

20
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:50,866
so I was just taking on these odd jobs

21
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:52,266
you read a programming book

22
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:54,100
do you still read programming books

23
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,166
I read a book on PHP once for a job

24
00:00:57,366 --> 00:00:57,733
um

25
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:00,033
I did read the kubernetes book

26
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:01,866
I've always been teaching

27
00:01:01,866 --> 00:01:03,433
when I was a little kid

28
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:06,233
I used to teach grown ups Excel skills

29
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,100
helping people with their homework

30
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,533
was a good source of connection

31
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,433
you did that for free I got paid

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,600
if you think about like the business of education

33
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,133
there's there's like so much stuff that you need to do

34
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:18,166
that isn't teaching

35
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,800
if you have to choose right

36
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,733
you can either work with Python

37
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:24,900
the programming language or people what would

38
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,500
you choose so I love Python so much

39
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,300
but I think actually people

40
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,666
if you wanna build something big

41
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:31,900
it's a it's a team sport

42
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,866
people are getting to a point where

43
00:01:33,866 --> 00:01:37,300
we're realizing what the uniquely human skills are

44
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,800
a metaphor I really like is soccer um

45
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,933
your individual skills as a soccer player really matter

46
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:43,700
quite a lot

47
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,000
a lot of emphasis is placed on passing the ball really

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,600
really well

49
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,900
hello everyone I'm Sheena um

00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:51,466
watch me on PyPodcasts

51
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:53,833
we're gonna be talking about PyCon Africa

52
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:56,266
I'm based in South Africa and it's in my hometown

53
00:01:56,266 --> 00:01:59,100
and we'll also be talking about teaching Python

54
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,566
and teaching teamwork

55
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:10,900
