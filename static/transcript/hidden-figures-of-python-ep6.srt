00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,774
Hi, everybody.

2
00:00:21,775 --> 00:00:24,022
Welcome to PyPodcats, the Hidden

3
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:26,326
Figures of Python podcast series.

4
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:28,410
The purpose of the PyPodcats is

5
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:30,938
to highlight the voices from underrepresented

6
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:32,830
group members of the Python community.

7
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,725
We follow the PSF's

8
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:35,922
code of conduct

9
00:00:35,923 --> 00:00:38,266
to help our interactions and to keep

10
00:00:38,267 --> 00:00:41,550
Python a positive, successful, and growing community.

11
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,441
You can check out

12
00:00:43,442 --> 00:00:46,338
pypodcats.live/conduct

13
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:47,610
for more information.

14
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:49,490
So let's begin.

15
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:51,050
My name is Mariatta.

16
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,490
I live in Vancouver, Canada.

17
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:55,922
So I'm involved in the Python open

18
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:58,098
source community in a lot of ways.

19
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,758
I'm one of the Python core developers.

20
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,750
I also do public speaking.

21
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:06,710
I've been attending lots of conferences to share

22
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:10,206
my experiences and my experiences with Python and

23
00:01:10,207 --> 00:01:12,870
with contributing to open source projects.

24
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:15,510
I'm currently self employed.

25
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:16,958
I do software consulting.

26
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,930
Maybe I'll pass it to Cheuk.

27
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,168
Yeah, hi, I'm Cheuk and I have been working for,

28
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:28,140
I've been volunteering for a lot of conferences.

29
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,640
I tend to not count these days

30
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:32,420
because otherwise it would give me anxiety.

31
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,560
I'm currently now serving in the PSF Board and

32
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:43,528
yeah, so happy to do more of these.

33
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:47,688
I'm glad that everybody loved PyPodcats and so

34
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:50,544
we are happy to have Nihanika today with us.

35
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:53,306
Thank you so much, Mariatta and Cheuk.

36
00:01:53,307 --> 00:01:54,618
I am Niharika, everybody.

37
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:56,802
I'm really, really excited to be joining this

38
00:01:56,803 --> 00:02:00,138
episode of PyPodcats with two eminent ladies

39
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:02,218
that I look up to in Python community.

40
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:04,922
And I'm really, really excited to be here.

41
00:02:04,923 --> 00:02:08,794
I'm here to share my experiences in Python

42
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,938
community, in open source, and also some of

43
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:15,946
the most interesting things I learned and the

44
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:18,632
fun I had being part of this community.

45
00:02:18,633 --> 00:02:21,656
And thank you so much once again for

46
00:02:21,657 --> 00:02:23,440
giving me this opportunity to be on to

47
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:26,488
this PyPodcats and really excited.

48
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:30,020
Looking forward to hearing more and chatting with you.

49
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,712
Thank you.

50
00:02:31,713 --> 00:02:34,592
As mentioned, one of the goals of our

51
00:02:34,593 --> 00:02:38,072
podcast is really to share stories and journeys

52
00:02:38,073 --> 00:02:41,100
of underrepresented group members in this community.

53
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,584
And I think I heard about

54
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:45,568
your story and it's really exciting.

55
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:48,008
I feel like more people should know about

56
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:50,276
you and then learn from your journey and

57
00:02:50,277 --> 00:02:52,740
then to inspire lots of people.

58
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:55,004
So can you tell our

59
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:57,636
listeners your journey in technology?

60
00:02:57,637 --> 00:03:01,620
I know you studied technology and you graduated from

61
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:06,820
University recently, but share that with us, definitely.

62
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:09,492
So basically, I'm right now working

63
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:12,124
as software developer at Accenture.

64
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:15,296
It's been three years now, and one of the

65
00:03:15,297 --> 00:03:18,512
most challenging part for me in my career has

66
00:03:18,513 --> 00:03:24,696
been job, and working after graduation, job.

67
00:03:24,697 --> 00:03:25,920
Everything has been quite challenging.

68
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:30,848
I graduated during COVID and getting a job, sticking to a

69
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:33,688
job that I never wanted to be in, and missing my

70
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:36,576
dream job, or not able to fulfill my goals has been

71
00:03:36,577 --> 00:03:41,032
one of the greatest disappointments I would say I had.

72
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:42,940
And it's been a roller coaster.

73
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,040
But then there is,

74
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:48,776
there was one thing that always kept me going,

75
00:03:48,777 --> 00:03:51,752
or other than job, there is one thing that,

76
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:54,256
that made me do a lot of stuff,

77
00:03:54,257 --> 00:03:59,840
explore every technological aspect is, participating and contributing

78
00:03:59,841 --> 00:04:02,220
to open source and Python community.

79
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,528
I think definitely coming from a women's University

80
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:10,368
or women's Institute in my place here, it's

81
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:12,152
one of the greatest asset I had.

82
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:15,292
The amount of encouragement I got during and also

83
00:04:15,293 --> 00:04:21,120
after my college to contribute to open source community

84
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,772
and to know the value of being woman in

85
00:04:25,773 --> 00:04:28,748
tech and help more and more women.

86
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:32,788
All these aspects, I think I got to experience

87
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:36,732
and learn from early stage in my college.

88
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:38,796
Not a well known college, but yet I got

89
00:04:38,797 --> 00:04:41,468
the opportunities and made the best use of it.

90
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:43,236
I think this community gave me a

91
00:04:43,237 --> 00:04:46,972
lot of strength to work professionally.

92
00:04:46,973 --> 00:04:49,020
As I said, this wasn't the job

93
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:51,284
that I wanted to be in. Later,

94
00:04:51,285 --> 00:04:54,476
dealing with a lot of anxieties

95
00:04:54,477 --> 00:04:57,060
and stress, depressions, I couldn't

96
00:04:57,061 --> 00:05:00,404
much I feel I achieve in terms of

97
00:05:00,405 --> 00:05:02,420
job according to the goals I said.

98
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:07,404
But then this community participating in Python events,

99
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:10,444
conferences, other than my job, has always given

100
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:12,740
me that strength to keep going.

101
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:13,812
And I love.

102
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,636
I love being part of this community, and

103
00:05:16,637 --> 00:05:18,300
it has given me a lot of strength.

104
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:21,132
And I also would suggest a lot of women

105
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:23,540
to be part of this, no matter how you're

106
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:27,000
doing, personally or professionally in your life.

107
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,468
Yeah.

108
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:30,320
May I ask, what's your dream job?

109
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:38,240
My dream job, definitely.

110
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,844
I would say it's nothing like a particular dream job.

111
00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:45,032
I just wanted to be an entrepreneur, being

112
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:48,288
honest, and I wanted to start that from

113
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:50,624
an early stage of my career.

114
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,488
But that's another thing that I really couldn't

115
00:05:53,489 --> 00:05:55,304
work on it on the right time.

116
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:57,384
And I definitely consider myself a

117
00:05:57,385 --> 00:05:59,340
failure in that particular aspect.

118
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,848
But then, as I work through at.

119
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:07,280
You can still be an entrepreneur!

120
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:11,256
Probably I wanted to end up in a job

121
00:06:11,257 --> 00:06:13,672
which is probably more high paying in a big

122
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:17,332
giant FAANG, as people mentioned with that, there's a

123
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,172
lot of peer pressure in tech industry.

124
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:22,900
If you see in India and also elsewhere, that

125
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:25,884
your first job after graduation is into a FAANG

126
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:30,436
or a big multinational company, which is very, very

127
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:34,280
high paying, and you're kind of doing great.

128
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,948
Yeah, but that.

129
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:38,724
That definitely didn't happen.

130
00:06:38,725 --> 00:06:40,596
But I'm really fortunate to be in the company

131
00:06:40,597 --> 00:06:43,420
that I am in now and doing my best.

132
00:06:43,421 --> 00:06:47,856
However, it is probably I couldn't have explored some

133
00:06:47,857 --> 00:06:50,840
other stuff around the globe other than my job,

134
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:53,680
if I wouldn't have been in this particular company.

135
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:55,540
Probably it was written this way.

136
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,784
Yeah.

137
00:06:56,785 --> 00:06:58,504
And I think you can still be

138
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:00,176
an entrepreneur, and I'm glad that

139
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:01,984
you have the spirit for it.

140
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:05,216
Yeah, I feel like your career just started.

141
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:09,768
I know there is, like, you can still work towards

142
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:14,692
your dream, your dream job, I'm sure of that. Yeah.

143
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:16,028
But it's.

144
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:17,116
It was.

145
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:20,396
I felt somewhat sad to hear about, you

146
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:22,868
know, things that were depressing for you.

147
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:24,924
And although I'm glad to hear that, you know, the

148
00:07:24,925 --> 00:07:29,100
Python community was there for you, maybe if you could

149
00:07:29,101 --> 00:07:31,276
share a little bit, like how do you,

150
00:07:31,277 --> 00:07:33,956
how did you find the Python community and

151
00:07:33,957 --> 00:07:37,462
maybe how did the community help you?

152
00:07:37,463 --> 00:07:38,950
Because you mentioned that, you know.

153
00:07:38,951 --> 00:07:39,970
Yeah, sure, sure.

154
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,310
Firstly, I started my open source journey,

155
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:47,006
because through open source was my initial

156
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:50,838
step to exploring Python, or Python community.

157
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:53,846
And then PyLadies, I think it was PyCon

158
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:57,550
India in 2017, which was my first conference.

159
00:07:57,551 --> 00:08:01,930
From there, I started contributing to FOSSASIA,

160
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:06,346
and from FOSSASIA organization, I discovered Python

161
00:08:06,347 --> 00:08:09,110
community, Linux, and many other communities.

162
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,098
But then, PyLadies was something that stuck

163
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:17,234
to my heart a bit more closer.

164
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:20,306
As I said, coming from a women's college somewhat,

165
00:08:20,307 --> 00:08:24,578
I was focusing on how women oriented communities are

166
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:28,466
running around, other than how the institute runs.

167
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,690
And that's how I explored PyLadies.

168
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:33,202
And initially, I didn't know anything

169
00:08:33,203 --> 00:08:35,102
about coding because I was not,

170
00:08:35,103 --> 00:08:37,126
not a person who was into geek,

171
00:08:37,127 --> 00:08:39,741
who's geek into coding, or who loved

172
00:08:39,742 --> 00:08:43,566
working on coding and software stuff initially.

173
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:46,494
But then slowly after coming to Python, I realized

174
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:50,790
it's not just the code contribution that you do,

175
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:54,022
it's more to it. You do through documentation,

176
00:08:54,023 --> 00:08:57,214
there are many unsung stories, I would say,

177
00:08:57,215 --> 00:09:00,430
background work that goes on in community service.

178
00:09:00,431 --> 00:09:03,604
You volunteer, you organize a meetup, and you host,

179
00:09:03,605 --> 00:09:08,620
even booth, which encourages women to more volunteer or

180
00:09:08,621 --> 00:09:12,532
start in other communities, which empower women.

181
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:16,484
So in this way, I think PyCon has helped me.

182
00:09:16,485 --> 00:09:18,644
And since then, there's never going back.

183
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:19,884
I kept contributing, I

184
00:09:19,885 --> 00:09:22,548
kept participating, volunteering. Even

185
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:25,028
it is a tiny job, like being

186
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:28,548
a moderator or anything online, offline.

187
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:31,050
I've had always given my best.

188
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:35,690
I try to participate because people, it's the people of

189
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:41,138
Python community who give you that warmth, and who, and

190
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:44,506
mainly the women in Python communities who say, it's okay

191
00:09:44,507 --> 00:09:47,170
if you're unable to work well, or if you're not

192
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,882
professionally well, be part of this community.

193
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:50,978
You can develop a lot

194
00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:52,950
and get opportunities through this.

195
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:58,954
And in that way, I just kept doing my best.

196
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:03,806
And now whenever I'm sad, I'm not happy working

197
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:06,534
professionally with my job or any stress I have.

198
00:10:06,535 --> 00:10:09,558
It's always the women in this community that I

199
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:13,958
reach out to and say, I'm just stuck.

200
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:16,102
I don't know how to work on this.

201
00:10:16,103 --> 00:10:18,806
And probably I'm not happy with my pay.

202
00:10:18,807 --> 00:10:21,150
Anything related to anything. It is.

203
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:24,254
They say, don't worry, these are the opportunities.

204
00:10:24,255 --> 00:10:25,566
And they keep sharing a lot

205
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,330
of opportunities that I can

206
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:28,870
explore. Yeah.

207
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:31,086
In that way, it just kept going on.

208
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:36,038
So Python meetups and conferences are my,

209
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,530
my sa... I think they are my savior.

210
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,918
They save me from whatever I go

211
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:45,438
through in my personal and monotonous life.

212
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:47,726
Yeah, I'm really glad to hear that.

213
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:49,774
And I feel so relatable.

214
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:52,530
I think I.

215
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,816
I faced what you faced, too,

216
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:57,808
like, feeling unhappy at work.

217
00:10:57,809 --> 00:10:59,760
And then it's the same as you.

218
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:03,296
Like, finding people like Cheuk, like Georgi, you

219
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:06,140
know, talking to them, who also understand what

220
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,088
the challenges we face as women in tech,

221
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:12,200
you know, is really helpful.

222
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:13,680
So I'm really glad that you

223
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:16,136
found your, you know, your community.

224
00:11:16,137 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm interested to learn more,

225
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:19,664
I know you said,

226
00:11:19,665 --> 00:11:21,310
you said you did contribute to

227
00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:22,918
FOSSASIA, and I know you,

228
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:26,102
You're also contributing to Google Summer of code?

229
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:28,438
Can you talk more about what did

230
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:30,970
you do during Google summer of code (GSOC)?

231
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,710
I mean, I didn't actually do my GSOC

232
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:38,750
but then I was trying for that.

233
00:11:38,751 --> 00:11:40,990
Yeah, I didn't do GSOC.

234
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,646
I couldn't make it to Google Summer.

235
00:11:43,647 --> 00:11:46,318
of Code, that was, I think, my first failure,

236
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:48,886
for which I was actually trying a lot.

237
00:11:48,887 --> 00:11:54,782
But then my community work, or however, participating just as

238
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:59,654
an attendee in FOSSASIA and also working on small, little

239
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:03,406
here and there, code commit, pull requests on new projects

240
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:05,526
that FOSSASIA was coming up with. I was more,

241
00:12:05,527 --> 00:12:07,102
I'm more interested in hardware.

242
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:10,694
So here and there, Arduino connections and stuff was

243
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:15,442
how I started doing my contribution to FOSSASIA.

244
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:20,010
And definitely writing the proposal to GSOC was what

245
00:12:20,011 --> 00:12:21,922
taught me, even though I didn't get into.

246
00:12:21,923 --> 00:12:26,578
But making that particular proposal that I worked on

247
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,466
for GSOC taught me how to even do documentation.

248
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:30,698
That was the first step that

249
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:32,506
taught me to do documentation.

250
00:12:32,507 --> 00:12:33,586
That is how I learned.

251
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,330
That's another part that I didn't make it to.

252
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:37,162
But then this is how I understood that.

253
00:12:37,163 --> 00:12:40,756
Oh, so you even elaborate and write about code.

254
00:12:40,757 --> 00:12:43,120
Not just coding, but you write about it.

255
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,852
And I think,

256
00:12:44,853 --> 00:12:46,972
I don't see this as a failure.

257
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:49,236
I think it's still a successful because

258
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:52,320
you still learn something valuable out of it.

259
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,180
Yeah, yeah.

260
00:12:58,181 --> 00:12:59,556
It doesn't matter how you get

261
00:12:59,557 --> 00:13:00,668
there, but now you're here.

262
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:05,508
So I think being able to write good proposals,

263
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:10,882
like selling your ideas to people, that's a skill

264
00:13:10,883 --> 00:13:14,666
that you can learn, and it's a good experience

265
00:13:14,667 --> 00:13:16,250
to know about how to do that.

266
00:13:16,251 --> 00:13:19,030
So I think that's still a successful story.

267
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,790
But how about the hardware?

268
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,810
What kind of hardware are you...

269
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:27,402
do you do or what?

270
00:13:27,403 --> 00:13:30,514
I don't know, the terminology, like, do you make or,

271
00:13:30,515 --> 00:13:31,910
do you work with hardware?

272
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,608
Definitely. When,

273
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:35,048
when it comes to hardware, I think

274
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:37,488
it's somewhat directly related to the branch

275
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:38,728
or the domain that I come from.

276
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:43,448
I'm an electrical engineer, and I mean, right

277
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:46,848
from day one, more than working on, like,

278
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:49,048
building a software, I was more interested in

279
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:51,512
building hardware which actually shows.

280
00:13:51,513 --> 00:13:53,696
Shows you a prototype and gives you a

281
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:56,280
satisfaction that you are at least working.

282
00:13:56,281 --> 00:13:57,920
That's what I believe.

283
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,740
Like building a..... a small....

284
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,420
What do I say?

285
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,520
A kind of Googlee Lens, or a kind of

286
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:11,120
prototype of eyewear for blind people to see and

287
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:16,656
understand things, or probably building some Med tech projects

288
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:20,408
which are for heart ECG detections, like basic stuff

289
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:23,616
that I started with, and then from there, working

290
00:14:23,617 --> 00:14:26,944
on Raspberry Pi, and that's how I explored Python. How,

291
00:14:26,945 --> 00:14:27,940
how....

292
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:31,920
How amazing it goes with Raspberry PI.

293
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,492
Yeah.

294
00:14:33,493 --> 00:14:38,620
Is there a project you want to highlight or showcase here

295
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:42,612
that you use Raspberry Pi that you want to tell

296
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:43,986
our audience about?

297
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:45,988
Showcasing.

298
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:47,724
Showcasing is like, I think I have

299
00:14:47,725 --> 00:14:49,600
to search my showcase or my,

300
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,080
to actually show the project.

301
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,613
The one thing that you're proud of.

302
00:15:01,113 --> 00:15:02,148
Definitely. There is,

303
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:04,484
There is one project that I think

304
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:07,760
I am definitely proud of is.

305
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,684
Until then, I was, like, normally working on

306
00:15:11,685 --> 00:15:15,548
building some small, small code related hardware prototypes

307
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:19,188
and different hackathons, like a small processor for

308
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:20,780
running LED light and stuff.

309
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:23,516
But then came an opportunity in my final

310
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:25,772
year project, where I worked with the,

311
00:15:25,773 --> 00:15:28,028
a prestigious institute here, Indian Institute

312
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:30,080
of Technology, which we call IIT.

313
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,972
I had a final year project which was

314
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:36,780
a power system, electrical energy, that I work

315
00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:40,652
with from a Raspberry Pi system.

316
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:43,620
So it was like an energy monitoring system in my

317
00:15:43,621 --> 00:15:48,068
whole campus, where we were coding and we were linking

318
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:53,556
a Raspberry Pi with the electrical meters or the substation

319
00:15:53,557 --> 00:15:59,148
meters that we have in our campus energy buildings.

320
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:03,492
We connected that to Raspberry Pi prototype, which

321
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:07,396
helped in monitoring the power fluctuations or power

322
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:11,060
cuts in a particular building in my college.

323
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:15,596
And we were monitoring and we even made web app for it.

324
00:16:15,597 --> 00:16:16,996
So that web app.

325
00:16:16,997 --> 00:16:19,204
So in this way, how much energy a

326
00:16:19,205 --> 00:16:23,200
particular building in my campus is consuming.

327
00:16:23,201 --> 00:16:25,016
And how can that Raspberry Pi

328
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,472
help in controlling or monitoring it?

329
00:16:27,473 --> 00:16:29,360
That is what monitoring campus

330
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:31,152
energy monitoring system is about.

331
00:16:31,153 --> 00:16:34,880
So in this way, it was a huge.

332
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:37,176
Is there something we can see online?

333
00:16:37,177 --> 00:16:38,620
Do you still have the website?

334
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,260
Online? Website?

335
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,584
Yeah.

336
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,504
Do you have the website?

337
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:46,184
Maybe you can send it to us and we will put it.

338
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:47,380
Yeah, sure.

339
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:48,666
Yeah.

340
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:51,618
You can actually explore that.

341
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:53,978
I'm totally like a kid regarding hardware.

342
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,730
I can only do something like playing

343
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:57,226
with LED lights and that's it.

344
00:16:57,227 --> 00:17:02,330
You know, I don't do anything that, like, useful.

345
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:03,670
That's really cool.

346
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:05,630
Yeah.

347
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,993
I have a Raspberry PI and I'm still figuring

348
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,530
out what else can I do with it.

349
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:12,498
So it's interesting to hear

350
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,410
what other people are doing.

351
00:17:14,411 --> 00:17:16,185
I'd like to learn more.

352
00:17:16,186 --> 00:17:18,914
You mentioned that you went to women only school.

353
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:20,914
Can you tell us what it's like?

354
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:25,882
So I come from this institute called as BVRIT.

355
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:27,386
It was a new institute.

356
00:17:27,387 --> 00:17:31,082
A new, new institute in my, in my city.

357
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,418
I think I was the, I was the

358
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,282
fourth batch who actually joined the college.

359
00:17:36,283 --> 00:17:37,194
It was that new.

360
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:40,586
But then I saw how amazing the University was

361
00:17:40,587 --> 00:17:43,082
right from its that like, there was the first

362
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:45,110
batch itself had a GSOC intern.

363
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:52,378
And yeah, she was quite engaged

364
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:54,730
in open source and FOSSASIA. She was.

365
00:17:54,731 --> 00:17:57,018
She also started her journey with FOSSASIA.

366
00:17:57,019 --> 00:17:58,642
And there are many other women

367
00:17:58,643 --> 00:17:59,850
as well who are contributing.

368
00:17:59,851 --> 00:18:02,570
And I was quite amused that being a new and

369
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:06,722
not so known Univer, institute, it has done a lot.

370
00:18:06,723 --> 00:18:09,314
So even the little opportunities that I got in my

371
00:18:09,315 --> 00:18:14,718
institute, like we had a small meetup by FOSSASIA.

372
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,806
That was the first meetup that was

373
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:18,926
organized in my institute that gave me

374
00:18:18,927 --> 00:18:21,566
a kickstart to exploring open source.

375
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,542
I think that was even the first time

376
00:18:23,543 --> 00:18:27,726
I explored something called as GitHub, edit, commit,

377
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:32,326
pull, request, everything about open source documentation, how

378
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:35,734
important it is more than code contribution.

379
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:38,342
And how can you explore open source

380
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:42,260
projects through documentation and all these steps?

381
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:43,220
Slowly, slowly.

382
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:46,196
I think I was over enthusiastic or an extrovert.

383
00:18:46,197 --> 00:18:51,092
You can say who was, who was ready to do anything.

384
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:53,972
Any opportunity that I get in terms of exploring

385
00:18:53,973 --> 00:18:56,004
tech or even non tech, I was ready.

386
00:18:56,005 --> 00:19:00,556
And I think that enthusiasm in one way was good, that it

387
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:04,516
brought me to the place that I am in right now.

388
00:19:04,517 --> 00:19:06,068
The opportunity that I'm able to get.

389
00:19:06,069 --> 00:19:09,028
I'm speaking with you people across who are from

390
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:12,828
different places and doing a lot of crazy stuff.

391
00:19:12,829 --> 00:19:16,676
So I think, entrepreneur and you

392
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:18,660
should not give up your dream.

393
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:20,600
Yeah, yeah.

394
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,068
I think it's really cool that they're

395
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:26,588
telling you about open source, right.

396
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:30,036
At, you know, during university, during college, because I

397
00:19:30,037 --> 00:19:34,500
didn't, they talk about open source when I was

398
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:37,862
going to University, but it was very basic.

399
00:19:37,863 --> 00:19:40,918
They just, they didn't teach us how to be involved.

400
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:42,398
They just teach us,

401
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:44,870
open source is like, these are the license.

402
00:19:44,871 --> 00:19:46,926
This is, it means if the code is

403
00:19:46,927 --> 00:19:49,446
available or something like that, but they didn't

404
00:19:49,447 --> 00:19:52,290
really teach us how to collaborate or.

405
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,702
So I think that's a really good experience for you.

406
00:19:56,703 --> 00:19:58,710
That's what I want to say for beginners.

407
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:01,454
For beginners like me, or for many women who

408
00:20:01,455 --> 00:20:03,846
just gets started or who just want to understand

409
00:20:03,847 --> 00:20:06,934
what open source or even tech industry is.

410
00:20:06,935 --> 00:20:11,350
It's not that the code, code part that starts with.

411
00:20:11,351 --> 00:20:14,286
I would not agree because no person as

412
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:17,078
a beginner knows how to code really well.

413
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:19,574
Everyone is like even less than a beginner

414
00:20:19,575 --> 00:20:21,478
when they get started with their open source.

415
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:26,406
So probably it's how, it's understanding the documentation, getting

416
00:20:26,407 --> 00:20:30,806
involved in the meetups, conferences, probably that could be

417
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:33,382
the way they can get started with the coding

418
00:20:33,383 --> 00:20:36,790
part as well, the code contributions as well.

419
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,454
So, yeah, every time I contribute to a

420
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:41,206
new project, I feel like a beginner.

421
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:43,222
Like, because you're not familiar with it.

422
00:20:43,223 --> 00:20:45,894
It's like, I think it's absolutely fine if you

423
00:20:45,895 --> 00:20:48,690
feel like a beginner because that's the normal thing.

424
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,650
Exactly, exactly. Yeah.

425
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,302
So can I ask then,

426
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:57,174
it's because you went to women only, you

427
00:20:57,175 --> 00:21:00,146
know, from women only school and then when

428
00:21:00,147 --> 00:21:01,922
you went into your professional life.

429
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:04,714
Of course, it's not all women.

430
00:21:04,715 --> 00:21:06,418
And in my, I don't know about

431
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:08,470
you, in my experience, mostly men.

432
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,394
How do you find the difference between

433
00:21:12,395 --> 00:21:15,594
these two, you know, environment, I think.

434
00:21:15,595 --> 00:21:17,666
Definitely, like when you travel to a

435
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:19,950
new country, you experience culture shock.

436
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:24,074
But for me, yeah, when you experience culture shock,

437
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:27,502
but definitely for me, it was when I went

438
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:29,494
from a, coming from a women's university where it,

439
00:21:29,495 --> 00:21:33,102
it's a bit tightly packed with one gender-oriented

440
00:21:33,103 --> 00:21:37,878
goals, and goal settings, or teachings, or environment, stepping

441
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,694
into the industry, or world.

442
00:21:39,695 --> 00:21:42,286
I started it from the University, like from

443
00:21:42,287 --> 00:21:45,582
my University as well, getting involved in Toastmasters,

444
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,646
trying to interact with other genders and stuff.

445
00:21:48,647 --> 00:21:51,550
But then it was definitely a tech shock for me.

446
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:53,190
Like culture shock, I would have

447
00:21:53,191 --> 00:21:56,582
my own word term, tech shock.

448
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,782
That is, I saw the whole industry

449
00:21:58,783 --> 00:22:01,750
in general is really dominated by men.

450
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:05,198
I saw more men involved. It's,

451
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:09,350
I saw men a lot into development that,

452
00:22:09,351 --> 00:22:12,294
this, organizing and stuff, more men, men.

453
00:22:12,295 --> 00:22:15,942
And I was like, okay, here there is a bit less

454
00:22:15,943 --> 00:22:20,910
ratio and it's definitely a bit like men are more involved.

455
00:22:20,911 --> 00:22:24,430
But then in that, from this phase to that phase,

456
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:28,090
I thought, as a woman, I have to do something.

457
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,086
I have to do something.

458
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:32,670
It was definitely difficult for me initially.

459
00:22:32,671 --> 00:22:35,686
Like, even though I'm an extrovert, for me it

460
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,390
was inside I felt like I'm an introvert.

461
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:42,910
To get conversation started with men asking me, please guide

462
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:45,614
in my career, or how can I, as a woman

463
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:50,328
as well start contributing and volunteering, or even as a

464
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:52,944
code contribution, how can I get started?

465
00:22:52,945 --> 00:22:55,600
It was definitely a bit difficult for me initially.

466
00:22:55,601 --> 00:22:59,288
But then thanks to PyLadies and Women Who Code,

467
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:05,752
there are many other communities who balanced the gender tension

468
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:08,680
that I had in my mind during the shift.

469
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:12,072
I saw, no, there are women communities who are working.

470
00:23:12,073 --> 00:23:14,432
I can go there and I can even come here.

471
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:16,728
I can balance in between both because in my

472
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,342
job, I, my whole team has more men.

473
00:23:19,343 --> 00:23:21,068
Seriously, it's more men.

474
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:25,572
So this is the way this community taught me how

475
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:29,676
to behave, how to speak, how I should maintain my

476
00:23:29,677 --> 00:23:36,244
personality while balancing both in profession and while trying to

477
00:23:36,245 --> 00:23:39,080
get myself involved in this community work.

478
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,956
How's the work culture difference?

479
00:23:41,957 --> 00:23:45,748
Like an all women culture and all men culture?

480
00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:47,474
Do you think? Kind of,

481
00:23:47,475 --> 00:23:50,242
the power hierarchy is a little bit different?

482
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:52,098
Yeah, yeah, it's definitely different.

483
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:55,106
When you, when you deal with more woman oriented, a

484
00:23:55,107 --> 00:23:57,986
lot of attention is given to you, just to you.

485
00:23:57,987 --> 00:23:59,842
And every single thing you do

486
00:23:59,843 --> 00:24:03,210
as a woman is probably noticed.

487
00:24:03,211 --> 00:24:05,546
In general, whatever you do is noticed.

488
00:24:05,547 --> 00:24:07,186
And like, in terms of like a.

489
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:09,322
Yeah, she did this and she did amazing.

490
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,906
A small little thing or a job

491
00:24:11,907 --> 00:24:13,618
and a woman tries something new is

492
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:17,886
appreciated in communities and immediately they're given.

493
00:24:17,887 --> 00:24:20,086
When it comes to corporate, I think there

494
00:24:20,087 --> 00:24:22,846
is a lot of competition because you have

495
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:25,334
to handle another gender as well, even in

496
00:24:25,335 --> 00:24:28,270
terms of work, or setting, or achieving your

497
00:24:28,271 --> 00:24:32,014
goals, or getting that appreciation from your manager.

498
00:24:32,015 --> 00:24:34,262
Definitely there is competition that gives you a

499
00:24:34,263 --> 00:24:37,318
lot of pressure, unknowingly, a lot of pressure,

500
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:40,326
and you feel depressed and stressed out to

501
00:24:40,327 --> 00:24:43,140
make yourself more, more visible in job.

502
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,464
For me, while dealing that stress immediately, my gateway

503
00:24:48,465 --> 00:24:52,000
is probably just come to any meet up. Immediately.

504
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:54,160
I keep searching, is there any meetup.

505
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:56,020
Open source detoxing.

506
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,624
Any open source meetup which

507
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,024
is encouraging women as well?

508
00:25:03,025 --> 00:25:04,016
Any woman-oriented.

509
00:25:04,017 --> 00:25:05,096
I'm like, yes, this is there.

510
00:25:05,097 --> 00:25:06,100
I'm going in.

511
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,336
So maybe that's like part of this is the gender thing.

512
00:25:09,337 --> 00:25:10,888
Maybe part of it is because, you

513
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:14,220
know, corporate and community are different.

514
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,916
Yeah, definitely. Definitely.

515
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:18,804
If you don't mind sharing and you

516
00:25:18,805 --> 00:25:21,396
can say no, like, was there specific

517
00:25:21,397 --> 00:25:24,116
I don't know if you ever noticed

518
00:25:24,117 --> 00:25:29,628
maybe discrimination or something, if you're comfortable.

519
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:30,740
Yeah, sure, sure.

520
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:34,444
I think this is something openly to be discussed, because

521
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:38,012
only when you discuss, people get to know and feel,

522
00:25:38,013 --> 00:25:40,548
yeah, I'm not alone who is going through this.

523
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:43,052
I think definitely in.

524
00:25:43,053 --> 00:25:46,812
In my job or in my professional life, I often

525
00:25:46,813 --> 00:25:50,628
get to hear that women take a lot of leave.

526
00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:53,092
They are not that dedicated setting their

527
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,980
goals or completing their work on time.

528
00:25:55,981 --> 00:25:58,620
You take a lot of leaves. This.

529
00:25:58,621 --> 00:26:01,268
This is something that I get to hear. They go on a lot.

530
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,636
They take a lot of vacation, or

531
00:26:02,637 --> 00:26:04,108
they take a lot of leaves.

532
00:26:04,428 --> 00:26:05,860
Their me time.

533
00:26:05,861 --> 00:26:07,172
I think this is there.

534
00:26:07,173 --> 00:26:08,884
And also, they're like, no problem

535
00:26:08,885 --> 00:26:10,436
if you can't work more.

536
00:26:10,437 --> 00:26:15,108
The person, who, this man can handle working long hours,

537
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:17,084
there are a lot of other stuff as well.

538
00:26:17,085 --> 00:26:19,420
You can't handle this pressure.

539
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:21,380
You don't have much patience.

540
00:26:21,381 --> 00:26:25,044
This is generally a woman or a gender trait. This. This.

541
00:26:25,045 --> 00:26:26,132
This is a lot.

542
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:28,660
And you become easily emotional, which I am.

543
00:26:28,661 --> 00:26:31,324
A lot of women who are very sensitive or emotional,

544
00:26:31,325 --> 00:26:36,228
they cannot take any feed, any criteria, or they cannot

545
00:26:36,229 --> 00:26:41,554
take any a suggestion, or they take to heart.

546
00:26:41,555 --> 00:26:43,250
I mean, if I am suddenly said, you.

547
00:26:43,251 --> 00:26:44,378
You don't work well.

548
00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:45,658
She doesn't work well.

549
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:48,050
Her work is not visible. She's like that.

550
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:49,250
When they say, there are many

551
00:26:49,251 --> 00:26:50,914
women who take that very seriously,

552
00:26:50,915 --> 00:26:53,330
they become sensitive, emotional, and incorporate.

553
00:26:53,331 --> 00:26:56,482
When you work emotionally, you cannot survive.

554
00:26:56,483 --> 00:26:56,914
Yeah.

555
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,850
I think men also will be, like,

556
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,554
you know, hurt by those comments.

557
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:03,990
They're just, like, very hard and, like, it's not true.

558
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,068
Yeah.

559
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:07,668
You know, to me, though, it.

560
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,164
It's annoying that they.

561
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:13,320
They say women like in general. Right. I think.

562
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,004
And I feel that that's the pressure that you

563
00:27:17,005 --> 00:27:19,564
mentioned earlier, like, when you are only, like, one

564
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:22,772
of the few in the team, you have this

565
00:27:22,773 --> 00:27:25,796
pressure to make sure that they don't categorize you

566
00:27:25,797 --> 00:27:29,532
as, you know, the whole women, like, you're representing

567
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:33,164
for the whole group when you're just yourself. Right.

568
00:27:33,165 --> 00:27:36,276
It's not just women.

569
00:27:36,277 --> 00:27:38,604
I mean, even men go through this. I'm not just speaking.

570
00:27:38,605 --> 00:27:39,268
That's just.

571
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:40,876
Just focusing on women. But.

572
00:27:40,877 --> 00:27:44,972
But then there are few emotional traits that women have

573
00:27:44,973 --> 00:27:48,716
that they easily get affected with more than men.

574
00:27:48,717 --> 00:27:52,260
So probably that that becomes a reason.

575
00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:56,900
And I hear this, and then I see, other

576
00:27:56,901 --> 00:28:00,808
than corporate, there are few communities, including Python or

577
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:03,728
even some other non-tech communities, where they're,

578
00:28:03,729 --> 00:28:06,696
they're appreciating you, irrespective of your gender,

579
00:28:06,697 --> 00:28:10,464
your race, whatever your mental disabilities are.

580
00:28:10,465 --> 00:28:12,264
I see a lot of people from different

581
00:28:12,265 --> 00:28:15,024
genders coming in, happily, interacting with me, and

582
00:28:15,025 --> 00:28:16,984
they are like, dude, you are awesome.

583
00:28:16,985 --> 00:28:18,768
When they keep saying this, I'm

584
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:21,816
like, no, it's not difficult.

585
00:28:21,817 --> 00:28:24,496
There are other people as well who are

586
00:28:24,497 --> 00:28:28,780
different, but they are strong and doing well.

587
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,952
Yeah, I think women are more

588
00:28:30,953 --> 00:28:32,928
open to talk about the emotion.

589
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:35,800
So, like, we always talk about, like, now, the,

590
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:39,216
you know, the mental health care for men, you

591
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,640
know, kind of encourage men to also share their

592
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:43,280
emotion, you know, that kind of thing.

593
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:46,304
So, yeah, I think generally, like, you

594
00:28:46,305 --> 00:28:48,456
know, a good environment, working environment, is

595
00:28:48,457 --> 00:28:51,170
very important for everybody's mental health.

596
00:28:51,171 --> 00:28:53,870
Yeah, definitely, definitely.

597
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:58,730
But I'm so glad to hear that your exit is

598
00:28:58,731 --> 00:29:02,110
to find the Python community, the open source community.

599
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:07,430
Definitely, definitely safe space that we have here.

600
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,390
Exactly.

601
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:13,370
And there is one aspect I think I would

602
00:29:13,371 --> 00:29:15,874
really like to highlight, and I don't know if

603
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:18,690
this is definitely to highlight, but then I saw

604
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:23,478
this being practiced in this as part of this

605
00:29:23,479 --> 00:29:27,774
PyPodcats, and also as part of Python community.

606
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:31,830
Is that, like, in my personal life, my,

607
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:34,286
my younger brother, I have brother, and

608
00:29:34,287 --> 00:29:36,094
my brother is a special child.

609
00:29:36,095 --> 00:29:40,078
He's autistic. He is mentally challenged.

610
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:41,502
And that.

611
00:29:41,503 --> 00:29:43,910
That environment and me trying to do

612
00:29:43,911 --> 00:29:45,390
well so that I can even help.

613
00:29:45,391 --> 00:29:50,470
My brother has emotionally or mentally always been

614
00:29:50,471 --> 00:29:53,750
in my mind since my childhood, and then.

615
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:57,386
And it's like, I always thought that people

616
00:29:57,387 --> 00:30:00,890
with mental disabilities probably cannot do anything, or

617
00:30:00,891 --> 00:30:02,290
I don't know, how can I help them?

618
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:04,586
Are there any communities that are helping?

619
00:30:04,587 --> 00:30:08,042
And then I came to Python community, and this was very.

620
00:30:08,043 --> 00:30:08,786
Not just Python.

621
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:10,354
I know other communities are working, but this

622
00:30:10,355 --> 00:30:12,194
is what I observed being in Python communities,

623
00:30:12,195 --> 00:30:15,770
that how well people with disabilities or mental

624
00:30:15,771 --> 00:30:18,994
disabilities, physical disabilities, are doing wonders.

625
00:30:18,995 --> 00:30:25,110
I saw interview of Jessica, Jessica Tegner, who was.

626
00:30:25,111 --> 00:30:25,630
who was,

627
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:31,118
who was also a pure hidden gem in community.

628
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:34,526
I saw being visually challenging,

629
00:30:34,527 --> 00:30:36,334
how amazing she's doing.

630
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:38,278
I could never imagine someone doing like

631
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,246
that, even being a normal person.

632
00:30:40,247 --> 00:30:41,574
And this. This.

633
00:30:41,575 --> 00:30:42,942
This encouraged me a lot.

634
00:30:42,943 --> 00:30:45,310
And this also was one of the aspect

635
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:49,520
that I always wanted to emotionally get connected

636
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:53,712
and give my best to this community.

637
00:30:53,713 --> 00:30:54,880
And this.

638
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:58,040
This definitely was that point that always

639
00:30:58,041 --> 00:31:00,208
encouraged me and gave me energy.

640
00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:03,360
How amazing people in this community are.

641
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,928
I feel like everybody have a superpower

642
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:07,536
in the community that is hidden.

643
00:31:07,537 --> 00:31:10,464
And I'm still discovering everybody's superpower.

644
00:31:10,465 --> 00:31:12,760
Like, every day, I was like, you can do that?

645
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:15,286
You didn't tell me, like, you know, know

646
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:16,886
each other for so long, you know?

647
00:31:16,887 --> 00:31:17,358
Yes.

648
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:19,134
There's so many amazing things

649
00:31:19,135 --> 00:31:20,454
happening in the community.

650
00:31:20,455 --> 00:31:21,838
Like, there's, like, so many hidden

651
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:23,894
talents, you know, like, yeah.

652
00:31:23,895 --> 00:31:26,230
And we just need to have space.

653
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:29,254
We need space for them to share all of this. Right.

654
00:31:29,255 --> 00:31:31,526
That's why definitely this is one

655
00:31:31,527 --> 00:31:34,246
of the spaces for that. Yeah.

656
00:31:34,247 --> 00:31:35,422
Each time I even.

657
00:31:35,423 --> 00:31:40,166
I listen to each of our episodes that, like, I

658
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:45,410
am awed myself, like, really impressive to see them.

659
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:51,950
I think we are getting at the end of the session here.

660
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:55,118
Is there any other closing remarks or any,

661
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:58,270
do you have advice to share to the community?

662
00:31:58,271 --> 00:31:59,330
Definitely.

663
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,358
There are a few things that I

664
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:03,974
encountered, so I would also try to

665
00:32:03,975 --> 00:32:07,728
probably just tell people that probably this.

666
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:11,088
This assumption is wrong or it's. It's.

667
00:32:11,089 --> 00:32:12,440
There's more to it.

668
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:14,344
There are a few things that people are.

669
00:32:14,345 --> 00:32:16,600
A lot of people ask me or even

670
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:20,968
say, hey, Python community, or just these tech

671
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:24,392
communities are all about coding and speaking or

672
00:32:24,393 --> 00:32:28,432
being an entrepreneur, having a huge, huge tech,

673
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:30,400
great tech profile.

674
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:33,312
I did this. I did that. Entrepreneur. Is it,

675
00:32:33,313 --> 00:32:36,070
is it that you have to be a well established person

676
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:42,210
who even knows how to code, who's good at everything?

677
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:45,130
Only then, am I eligible to contribute?

678
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:47,050
This is an often question that I get.

679
00:32:47,051 --> 00:32:49,178
I'm not a good person at everything,

680
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:52,234
but I really am enthusiastic to contribute.

681
00:32:52,235 --> 00:32:54,266
I would say, yes, you're in the right place.

682
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:58,722
You really don't need to be on a well multitalented

683
00:32:58,723 --> 00:33:02,250
person in all the aspects to contribute to any community.

684
00:33:02,251 --> 00:33:05,176
Just start doing as volunteer.

685
00:33:05,177 --> 00:33:08,392
Make networks, a lot of background work.

686
00:33:08,393 --> 00:33:12,776
It's more than just speaking and, quote, contribution.

687
00:33:12,777 --> 00:33:14,800
Be part of an organization.

688
00:33:14,801 --> 00:33:16,384
Keep people engaged.

689
00:33:16,385 --> 00:33:19,000
Registration desk is my favorite place in

690
00:33:19,001 --> 00:33:22,160
conferences where I happily invite people.

691
00:33:22,161 --> 00:33:24,144
And those smiling faces on the first day

692
00:33:24,145 --> 00:33:29,472
of conference, being all these volunteering works, or

693
00:33:29,473 --> 00:33:33,040
just being an attendee and gracing a conference

694
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:35,848
and making it a huge, successful thing is

695
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:42,376
also more just being a multitalented person.

696
00:33:42,377 --> 00:33:45,416
You can just be a normal person and get started.

697
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:48,248
This is one thing I would like to say.

698
00:33:48,249 --> 00:33:49,456
Yeah, yeah.

699
00:33:49,457 --> 00:33:52,176
I mean, you are special, and I would

700
00:33:52,177 --> 00:33:54,328
say that I appreciate, but everybody is special,

701
00:33:54,329 --> 00:33:56,220
and I'm so glad that you're here.

702
00:33:56,221 --> 00:33:58,120
I'm so glad that everybody's here.

703
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,040
Right.

704
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,508
Well, thank you, everybody.

705
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:06,452
Thank you, Niharika, for joining

706
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:08,460
us and sharing your stories.

707
00:34:08,461 --> 00:34:11,212
I think it's really inspiring, and I really hope

708
00:34:11,213 --> 00:34:14,699
people who listen to your stories, they become inspired.

709
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,060
Like, they realize that, you know, they can do it, too.

710
00:34:18,061 --> 00:34:20,364
There's so many paths to the

711
00:34:20,365 --> 00:34:22,268
