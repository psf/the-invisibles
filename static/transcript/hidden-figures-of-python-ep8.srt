00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,544
Welcome to PyPodcats for our first episode of

2
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:28,192
2025 in the Hidden Figures of Python series.

3
00:00:28,193 --> 00:00:30,466
The purpose of this podcast, as you

4
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:32,930
might know, is to highlight voices from

5
00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:35,890
underrepresented group members of the Python community.

6
00:00:35,891 --> 00:00:37,514
Today we have a special guest,

7
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:41,450
Mojdeh, who just joined our organizing

8
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:43,154
She's joining our organizing group.

9
00:00:43,155 --> 00:00:46,914
And today's podcast is a little bit about

10
00:00:46,915 --> 00:00:50,714
short recap of 2024, introducing Mojdeh and letting

11
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:53,510
you know what are our plans for 2025.

12
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,818
And also if you want to support

13
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:59,634
the podcast, how can you do that?

14
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:03,986
We are now five organizers and we did want to

15
00:01:03,987 --> 00:01:06,162
have this one episode like we did last year.

16
00:01:06,163 --> 00:01:08,842
Our first episode was with all the hosts

17
00:01:08,843 --> 00:01:11,058
in one, kicking it off and everything.

18
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:14,706
But it turned out to be impossible to get all the five of

19
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:18,610
us in one time zone in one room at the same time.

20
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,290
We are so distributed all over the world.

21
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:25,220
So today is just Georgi, me, and Mojdeh.

22
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:27,396
We can start with a short round of introduction.

23
00:01:27,397 --> 00:01:28,252
Maybe some.

24
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:29,636
Maybe some of you still remember

25
00:01:29,637 --> 00:01:31,780
Georgi from the previous episodes.

26
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:33,196
Georgi, do you want to say what

27
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:34,284
are you up to these days?

28
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:35,484
Who are you these days?

29
00:01:35,485 --> 00:01:37,228
Are you the same person like last year

30
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,324
or have you changed a little bit?

31
00:01:39,325 --> 00:01:41,980
Yep, I still have my nose, my eyes and

32
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:45,372
my mouth and still doing the same thing.

33
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:49,340
One of the Directors for PSF and this year I pick up.

34
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:50,806
I think actually last year I picked up

35
00:01:50,807 --> 00:01:54,422
a new role as the Treasurer too.

36
00:01:54,423 --> 00:01:57,830
Actually, both me and Tereza, we are leading

37
00:01:57,831 --> 00:02:01,190
the Diversity and Inclusion workgroup this year.

38
00:02:01,191 --> 00:02:04,070
So that's something new on our side.

39
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:06,246
So Tereza, you want to tell everyone a little

40
00:02:06,247 --> 00:02:08,310
bit about what you are doing this year?

41
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:11,590
Yeah, I guess for me a lot of things have changed.

42
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:13,590
I took a break from the Code of Conduct work

43
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:20,508
group and I also am experimenting with an unconventional, let's

44
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:24,548
say, work path, so to say I'm trying to become,

45
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:29,276
I'm working this year as a freelancer compared to the usual

46
00:02:29,277 --> 00:02:33,868
9 to 5, which is hard because I live in Germany

47
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:37,360
and Germany is not a country that encourages freelancing.

48
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,796
So for a person that does not like

49
00:02:39,797 --> 00:02:43,032
to do paperwork, this is a especially hard.

50
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:43,856
That is true.

51
00:02:43,857 --> 00:02:46,224
Paperwork is kind of tough.

52
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:47,264
Yeah.

53
00:02:47,265 --> 00:02:49,616
So I'm freelancing as a Data Career

54
00:02:49,617 --> 00:02:51,456
Coach, in case people are wondering.

55
00:02:51,457 --> 00:02:51,976
Right.

56
00:02:51,977 --> 00:02:54,136
I actually took a break this year too.

57
00:02:54,137 --> 00:02:58,360
I'm just really, really tired and I feel like I really

58
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:01,760
needed a break and sort things out and do some cool

59
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:04,344
projects which I'm not going to review right now.

60
00:03:04,345 --> 00:03:07,512
Until when it's out, then we can talk about it.

61
00:03:07,513 --> 00:03:08,408
But you know what?

62
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:10,416
We should talk more about Mojdeh

63
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:14,020
today because she is our new member.

64
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:15,900
And there's a lot about Mojdeh

65
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:18,500
that we should actually know.

66
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:22,388
So should we call you Moj or Mojdeh?

67
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:23,236
As you wish.

68
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:25,508
My close friends call me Moj, but.

69
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:27,364
And my full name is Mojdeh, so.

70
00:03:27,365 --> 00:03:30,480
And Mojdeh sometimes is difficult, so Moj is fine.

71
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,076
Okay, Mojdeh, you could just tell

72
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:34,560
us a little bit about yourself.

73
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,236
Yeah, I am really happy to be

74
00:03:37,237 --> 00:03:39,800
part of PyPodcats team this year.

75
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,460
So I'm originally from Iran.

76
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:48,370
I'm Iranian, I'm living in Paris and I'm 37.

77
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,078
Getting close to 40.

78
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,850
Then what about me?

79
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,022
I have a Bachelor in Electrical Electronics, master in

80
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:04,126
Computer Vision and PhD in Computer Vision and currently I'm working

81
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:08,214
as a data scientist project manager in Saint-Gobain.

82
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:11,326
And I love the community, so I try to

83
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:14,088
be part of the community whenever I can.

84
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:15,480
You are also part of the Code of

85
00:04:15,481 --> 00:04:17,911
Conduct workgroup with The PSF, right?

86
00:04:17,912 --> 00:04:19,504
Yes, I am part of the Code

87
00:04:19,505 --> 00:04:21,007
of Conduct and thank you, Tereza.

88
00:04:21,008 --> 00:04:22,760
You introduced me to the work group.

89
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:24,600
I think it's been two years now and

90
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:26,824
yeah, I'm still working with the work group.

91
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:30,120
I know what Saint-Gobain does, but maybe you can

92
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:32,120
actually talk a little bit because I have this

93
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:37,440
impression that they only do glasses, windows and glass.

94
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:39,658
So I was like, are you doing windows

95
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:42,874
and glass. Data about windows and glass?

96
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:43,658
Yeah.

97
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:47,666
So this year is the 360 anniversary of

98
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:52,978
Saint-Gobain and Saint-Gobain is umbrella that they doing.

99
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,170
They produce glass, originally started with that.

100
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:57,282
But any other construction materials.

101
00:04:57,283 --> 00:04:59,410
As a data scientist, any projects for any other

102
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:02,682
business of Saint-Gobain that they require analysis

103
00:05:02,683 --> 00:05:04,922
of their data or machine learning model.

104
00:05:04,923 --> 00:05:07,186
So it can be for the glass furnace, it

105
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:10,390
can be for distribution, e commerce, you name.

106
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,830
Whoa, interesting.

107
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,150
So most.

108
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:17,222
There is one thing that I'm curious about a little bit.

109
00:05:17,223 --> 00:05:18,606
So you said you are from Iran.

110
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:22,090
I think all of us here are not from where we live.

111
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,134
So we're from another place.

112
00:05:24,135 --> 00:05:27,270
How did you get to Europe or

113
00:05:27,271 --> 00:05:28,774
why did you come to Europe?

114
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:30,090
That's a nice question.

115
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,806
So I was fortunate enough to get a

116
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:36,478
scholarship and this scholarship I think still exists.

117
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,502
It's called Erasmus Mundus Scholarship for Master

118
00:05:39,503 --> 00:05:44,530
program and they provide specific scholarship for

119
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:47,010
For any students outside of Europe.

120
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:50,306
So I was lucky enough to get into one program

121
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:53,034
and the program is an amazing program because it allows

122
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:57,730
you to travel through different countries and different universities and

123
00:05:57,731 --> 00:06:00,866
so you get to make new friends and then if

124
00:06:00,867 --> 00:06:04,350
you're lucky, you get to stay and continue for thesis.

125
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,090
I remember The Erasmus program.

126
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:09,970
When I was doing my PhD in Hannover, it was.

127
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:13,842
I knew about Erasmus as the Erasmus parties.

128
00:06:13,843 --> 00:06:15,850
So there were a lot of parties.

129
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:21,710
Yeah, obviously there are, but you have to study too.

130
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,746
So tell me a little bit about how you get to start.

131
00:06:28,747 --> 00:06:31,466
Start to get involved with Python, the

132
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:34,110
language or even like the Python community.

133
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:42,270
Yeah, so I joined Euro SciPy conference back in 2016.

134
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:47,502
So and then yeah, I started really using Python

135
00:06:47,503 --> 00:06:50,278
from then and then getting to know the community

136
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,950
and this conference was a great opportunity to meet

137
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:57,190
a lot of open source contributors that they were

138
00:06:57,191 --> 00:07:02,470
also teaching introduction to Python and scientific Python packages.

139
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:05,910
So since then I got to know the community and

140
00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:10,638
then I helped a couple of years after helping organizing

141
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,542
the same conference and then we had a chance to

142
00:07:13,543 --> 00:07:16,516
have JupyterCon in Paris a couple of years ago.

143
00:07:16,517 --> 00:07:24,092
So we helped organizing JupyterCon and then from there, yes,

144
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:26,932
I was part of the community and trying to help.

145
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:31,636
And also I think within Euro SciPy I

146
00:07:31,637 --> 00:07:35,012
got to know about PyLadies and later on

147
00:07:35,013 --> 00:07:37,468
I became a member of PyLadies Paris.

148
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:40,100
So that was really nice.

149
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:41,480
Which year was that?

150
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,894
So this was 2020.

151
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,152
2020.

152
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:47,344
Oh wow.

153
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:48,928
I'm actually really curious.

154
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:51,880
I think for a lot of people it's not really

155
00:07:51,881 --> 00:07:54,340
clear what does Python have to do with glass?

156
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,560
I'm really looking through my window right now.

157
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:04,100
I don't see any Python code, hidden messages.

158
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,776
Maybe in the future you will have like

159
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,540
a screen as a glass and then.

160
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,600
Is that what you're working on?

161
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:16,358
Unfortunately, no, no, not yet. Not yet.

162
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:18,910
No, no, no, it's.

163
00:08:18,911 --> 00:08:21,414
I think it's. It can happen.

164
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:23,798
I think it's the life of a lot of people

165
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:28,086
actually currently in tech and I mean in the community

166
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:32,650
that yes, you have your carreer that is in industry

167
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,446
and then you also like the community.

168
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:36,885
So you try to be active in.

169
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:40,666
But your company, where you're working, your

170
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:43,738
institute is using Python for research or.

171
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:44,714
Sure, sure.

172
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:47,026
We have, I think we have research centers,

173
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,230
we have data science team, we have.

174
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,546
Yeah, we do.

175
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:54,522
We also do a lot of internal development.

176
00:08:54,523 --> 00:08:57,858
For instance, I mentioned one that. Yeah.

177
00:08:57,859 --> 00:09:00,050
How to optimize the energy consumption,

178
00:09:00,051 --> 00:09:02,066
how to reduce the CO2 footprint.

179
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:05,110
So these are things that we do.

180
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,590
I think this is interesting because most of the

181
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:10,070
time when we are in our little bubbles in

182
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:12,598
tech, we usually only interact with people that build

183
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:17,126
software and very few people sometimes you meet that

184
00:09:17,127 --> 00:09:23,782
are coming from a hardware also producing hardware industry

185
00:09:23,783 --> 00:09:26,486
and that's a little bit more manufacturing and so

186
00:09:26,487 --> 00:09:29,574
it's always interesting to see the use cases.

187
00:09:29,575 --> 00:09:32,846
Sometimes I think we also have guests who actually

188
00:09:32,847 --> 00:09:35,936
fiddle with more on like the IoT side.

189
00:09:35,937 --> 00:09:38,480
And it's also interesting because these are

190
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:42,192
things that it's not commonly talked about.

191
00:09:42,193 --> 00:09:44,592
We are usually talk mostly about the data,

192
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:47,264
talking about the language and not really about

193
00:09:47,265 --> 00:09:49,792
something else that Python can be used for.

194
00:09:49,793 --> 00:09:51,920
So that is why it's actually very

195
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:54,480
interesting to know more about that.

196
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:56,848
But I have another question to ask

197
00:09:56,849 --> 00:10:00,980
you, which is more about PyLadies Paris.

198
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:03,524
I mean, not many people actually

199
00:10:03,525 --> 00:10:06,200
knew that I'm French, but.

200
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,516
I'm French, but I live in Netherlands and I've

201
00:10:11,517 --> 00:10:16,228
never actually been to any PyLadies Paris event.

202
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:17,960
Oh, we have to invite you.

203
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,876
When is the next time that

204
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:22,260
you're planning to travel to Paris?

205
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:25,764
Well, I actually do go to France quite often,

206
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:28,936
going back like a few times a year. Yeah.

207
00:10:28,937 --> 00:10:30,144
So tell me a little bit more.

208
00:10:30,145 --> 00:10:34,792
Like, how often does the PyLadies Paris events

209
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:36,880
go on and what do you do?

210
00:10:36,881 --> 00:10:37,496
Yeah.

211
00:10:37,497 --> 00:10:40,088
So the chapter existed way before I joined.

212
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:45,848
And so I think during COVID the organizers

213
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:47,776
organized a couple of online events and I

214
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:50,384
joined just at 2020, just after Covid.

215
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:54,668
And since then we started with as two organizers,

216
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:56,468
then we became three and now we are five.

217
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:57,520
So we are happy.

218
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,564
Yes.

219
00:10:59,565 --> 00:11:03,348
And so we try to have meetup every other month

220
00:11:03,349 --> 00:11:08,820
and also sometimes workshop for contributing to open source.

221
00:11:08,821 --> 00:11:11,300
So we try to mix these two

222
00:11:11,301 --> 00:11:15,820
together and obviously trying to have speakers,

223
00:11:15,821 --> 00:11:19,220
female speakers or from underrepresented groups and.

224
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:20,588
Yeah, talks about Python.

225
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:22,174
Oh, something new that we

226
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:23,806
started doing since last year.

227
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:25,702
We try to have lighting talks.

228
00:11:25,703 --> 00:11:28,262
So we try to encourage the audience

229
00:11:28,263 --> 00:11:31,870
that participate and come talk for three

230
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:35,254
minutes is still, you know, growing.

231
00:11:35,255 --> 00:11:37,854
But we do see a couple of attendees that

232
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,054
are comfortable enough to present a lighting talk.

233
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:42,094
So that's nice to see.

234
00:11:42,095 --> 00:11:44,350
Well, that's actually a great idea.

235
00:11:44,351 --> 00:11:46,846
I think I remember recently I

236
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:50,088
went to this PyCon Taiwan. They had this.

237
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:53,152
I mean, most PyCon had lightning

238
00:11:53,153 --> 00:11:56,064
talks, but they're a little unique.

239
00:11:56,065 --> 00:12:00,520
They came out with the idea of like doing a countdown.

240
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:02,568
So when it's like almost time,

241
00:12:02,569 --> 00:12:05,208
you have like 10 seconds left.

242
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:09,592
Everyone from the audience would go, 10, 9, 8.

243
00:12:09,593 --> 00:12:12,840
And it was so funny because it just makes

244
00:12:12,841 --> 00:12:14,760
everybody go like, oh, no, no, no, no.

245
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:16,840
And then just speed up and.

246
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:18,936
And do really funny things.

247
00:12:18,937 --> 00:12:23,530
But I guess it's not going to work, probably for PyLadies,

248
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,790
because we want them to have the courage to come up

249
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:32,494
and to just at least try to speak or show or

250
00:12:32,495 --> 00:12:34,446
talk a little bit about what they're doing.

251
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:36,278
That's why I think skipping

252
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,646
the countdown will be better.

253
00:12:37,647 --> 00:12:39,318
Yeah. Yes. Yeah.

254
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:42,750
We are still searching to how to encourage

255
00:12:42,751 --> 00:12:45,166
our participants to be more active and I

256
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:47,302
think hopefully we will figure it out.

257
00:12:47,303 --> 00:12:50,612
But yeah, I'm going to get in touch, Georgi,

258
00:12:50,613 --> 00:12:53,960
to invite you for episode of PyLadiesParis.

259
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,644
Okay.

260
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:58,588
I will be happy to look forward to it.

261
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:00,332
So what are you currently working on?

262
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:04,748
Oh like projects or things?

263
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:07,340
My own project at work.

264
00:13:07,341 --> 00:13:10,084
I'm busy with work and stuff. Yes.

265
00:13:10,085 --> 00:13:15,328
So and then I'm reading this book that I'm

266
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:18,380
soon going to finish and I want to make

267
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,608
one page or two page summary of it.

268
00:13:21,609 --> 00:13:23,840
You know, just words or sentence.

269
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:26,600
So that's my current project.

270
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:28,184
Yeah, I guess that's it.

271
00:13:28,185 --> 00:13:30,144
I'm not doing other stuff.

272
00:13:30,145 --> 00:13:31,696
Which book are you reading?

273
00:13:31,697 --> 00:13:35,000
I think the name is that Think Again.

274
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:38,800
So I'm reading Think Again. Yeah.

275
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:40,032
Thanks Tereza.

276
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:41,260
You recommended it.

277
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,546
It's a book, Georgi, about that we

278
00:13:46,547 --> 00:13:48,230
should change our mind more often.

279
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:53,202
I was just talking with my partner recently about that.

280
00:13:53,203 --> 00:13:56,226
The only time we could expand and change

281
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:58,106
is to get out of our comfort zone.

282
00:13:58,107 --> 00:13:59,778
And that is a change.

283
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:04,650
And a lot of times we are so comfortable with the regular

284
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:09,214
thing like what we are used to and making that change is

285
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,294
kind of like fear of what we are not expecting.

286
00:14:12,295 --> 00:14:13,550
I think we are also kind of

287
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:16,610
like very strong culture of being right.

288
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,170
Yes.

289
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,766
And that's like very uncomfortable to accept that

290
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:24,894
you might be wrong and just to accept

291
00:14:24,895 --> 00:14:27,806
that you don't know everything about everything and

292
00:14:27,807 --> 00:14:29,838
be vulnerable out there with that.

293
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,214
So I think that's kind of setting up us

294
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:37,126
for not wanting to take risks sometimes without ego.

295
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,726
I think personally that will be the kind

296
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:42,582
of the new future where people will learn

297
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,694
to accept that they are not the best.

298
00:14:45,695 --> 00:14:48,478
Because not even leaders needs to know everything.

299
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:50,686
I mean no one knows any everything.

300
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:52,662
You don't, you have all the language models.

301
00:14:52,663 --> 00:14:54,150
You don't need to know everything anymore.

302
00:14:54,151 --> 00:14:55,290
Yeah, exactly.

303
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,542
I wanted to say that it still is important

304
00:14:58,543 --> 00:15:00,846
that even if you hear it from LLM or

305
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:02,718
read it from LLM, you question it.

306
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:06,672
So I mean the, the debate is old.

307
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:08,024
Like old in a sense.

308
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:11,352
I think when we were in school it was Wikipedia.

309
00:15:11,353 --> 00:15:12,792
They were saying don't do your homework.

310
00:15:12,793 --> 00:15:14,136
Copying from Wikipedia.

311
00:15:14,137 --> 00:15:15,272
Because it wasn't.

312
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:17,504
Because it's like the easy way out.

313
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:19,928
It was most of the time because it's

314
00:15:19,929 --> 00:15:23,824
a human built encyclopedia and it's prone to

315
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:27,720
subjectivity and it might not be objective sometimes.

316
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:28,960
And I think that's the same.

317
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:31,104
The LLMs are trained on public data

318
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:34,378
that people are producing and sometimes that's

319
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:37,018
also wrong or the inferences are wrong.

320
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,210
It does not.

321
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:42,690
I mean, happily, you know, the problem that we still have

322
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:47,170
to think about stuff doesn't go away, which means that if

323
00:15:47,171 --> 00:15:49,458
we do that, it's good for our brain health.

324
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:52,210
Otherwise, if we would have everything done for our

325
00:15:52,211 --> 00:15:54,138
brain and our brain doesn't have to do anything

326
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:56,746
anymore, we would grow old very fast.

327
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,402
Totally.

328
00:15:57,403 --> 00:15:57,850
Yeah.

329
00:15:57,851 --> 00:16:00,002
And denial at 6, at 40,

330
00:16:00,003 --> 00:16:01,990
you're already like, I don't know.

331
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,226
I don't know if you've seen a lot of

332
00:16:04,227 --> 00:16:07,106
cartoons already showing this kind of jokes where they

333
00:16:07,107 --> 00:16:09,266
are saying, like, people in the future will not

334
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:11,410
know how to think because they'll just get the

335
00:16:11,411 --> 00:16:14,162
LLMs to give them replies for everything.

336
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:16,450
Yeah, no, but I saw the news about like

337
00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:19,234
a high school kid that finished high school with

338
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:22,434
magna cum laude and then sued the high school

339
00:16:22,435 --> 00:16:24,986
because she didn't know how to read and write.

340
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:26,218
Oh, okay.

341
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,350
So, yeah. Wow.

342
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,972
To that level, I'm surprised with like good grades.

343
00:16:36,973 --> 00:16:37,560
Right.

344
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,220
So, yeah.

345
00:16:41,221 --> 00:16:45,684
I wanted to ask Moj, coming back to is,

346
00:16:45,685 --> 00:16:49,892
what do you do besides python events and work?

347
00:16:49,893 --> 00:16:53,468
Do you have any fun hobbies or not so fun hobbies?

348
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:55,380
Is there anything that you do that

349
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:57,388
you'd like to share with the audience?

350
00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:58,920
I don't know if you can call

351
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:01,128
it fun, but for me it's fun.

352
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:02,608
I like to go to dance

353
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:05,232
and Zumba classes and really it's.

354
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:08,407
Is the time that I can. Yes. Let it go.

355
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:10,127
You know, it's energetic.

356
00:17:10,128 --> 00:17:11,152
It's not like yoga.

357
00:17:11,153 --> 00:17:13,288
I know that I should do yoga more because

358
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:17,240
that's another way of letting it go yet.

359
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:21,880
Yeah, Zumba dances, dance classes is really my

360
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:24,016
favorite session and I try to do.

361
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:26,854
To go there once, one hour or two hours a week.

362
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:29,446
I personally feel that yoga is

363
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:31,430
a little too slow for me.

364
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:33,790
So I do, I do Pilates.

365
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,006
Any one of you listening here, if you

366
00:17:36,007 --> 00:17:38,574
don't know, actually Tereza is teaching yoga.

367
00:17:38,575 --> 00:17:41,910
Yes, that was, that was the thing that I did last year.

368
00:17:41,911 --> 00:17:43,262
I did a teacher training.

369
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,766
But that's why I was going to say that the yoga that I

370
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:49,398
teach is kind of more like a workout most of the time.

371
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:51,610
So because it's functional yoga and it has

372
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:54,498
a lot of like about strength and mobility.

373
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:57,634
So it doesn't really feel like stretchy,

374
00:17:57,635 --> 00:17:58,550
stretchy.

375
00:17:59,210 --> 00:17:59,990
Yeah.

376
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,858
I did a lot of pilates before and now that I'm

377
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:07,786
trying some yoga session, it's really hard because the, you know,

378
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,506
the way that you breathe is not the same and I

379
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:13,442
keep confusing between the two when I'm in yoga session.

380
00:18:13,443 --> 00:18:15,550
And that's the challenge right now.

381
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,556
Actually, I'm also starting to work

382
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,372
a little bit on, like, mobility.

383
00:18:22,373 --> 00:18:24,468
And a new sport that I picked

384
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:26,132
up was called the rope flow.

385
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:28,332
So it's like using the rope to just

386
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,940
fiddling around with it, and it kind of,

387
00:18:30,941 --> 00:18:33,588
like, help with the spine and the arms.

388
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:37,348
So, yeah, it's like, I got to work more with mobility.

389
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,316
That moves me to learn about road flow, I

390
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:43,636
guess it's like we are learning many different things.

391
00:18:43,637 --> 00:18:44,754
Like, you said most.

392
00:18:44,755 --> 00:18:47,674
You said, like, oh, you started with Pilates,

393
00:18:47,675 --> 00:18:49,018
and then you did a bit of yoga,

394
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:50,986
and then now you're doing, like, Zumba.

395
00:18:50,987 --> 00:18:52,874
And then, Tereza, you're doing, like, yoga,

396
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,850
but the yoga with something new.

397
00:18:54,851 --> 00:18:56,746
So things are always evolving.

398
00:18:56,747 --> 00:18:58,370
And I used to do capoeira, so.

399
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:04,370
I mean, yeah, I used to do

400
00:19:04,371 --> 00:19:06,682
Muay Thai until I got injured.

401
00:19:06,683 --> 00:19:08,106
Oh, yeah.

402
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:08,706
What?

403
00:19:08,707 --> 00:19:10,710
We can all kick ass. Good.

404
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,378
At least we can all kick ass.

405
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:14,030
Yeah.

406
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:15,914
Yeah.

407
00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:20,098
So is there any projects like you've been

408
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:22,210
wanting to do or you plan to do

409
00:19:22,211 --> 00:19:24,710
in future, like, in the next few years?

410
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,842
I do really like to continue organizing

411
00:19:28,843 --> 00:19:32,850
the workshop session for PyLadies, because the

412
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:34,546
audience, I mean, we get very.

413
00:19:34,547 --> 00:19:37,170
Maybe 10 to 15 attendees, but I think

414
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:41,706
it helps a lot, especially the carrier changes.

415
00:19:41,707 --> 00:19:44,630
So, for instance, if they come to the workshop or

416
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,026
we start learning how to contribute to open source and

417
00:19:49,027 --> 00:19:50,914
also meet the community, it helps a lot.

418
00:19:50,915 --> 00:19:53,330
So that's something that I want to do

419
00:19:53,331 --> 00:19:56,354
more this year and maybe the years after.

420
00:19:56,355 --> 00:20:00,018
And then personal project I won

421
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:01,554
a while back when I was.

422
00:20:01,555 --> 00:20:05,086
Maybe five or 10 years ago.

423
00:20:05,087 --> 00:20:06,174
Five is not.

424
00:20:06,175 --> 00:20:08,230
More like 10 years ago, I was painting,

425
00:20:08,231 --> 00:20:10,278
so I want to go back to painting.

426
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:13,950
So, yeah, I want to start doing that.

427
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,878
And see, I already have some ideas what I want to do.

428
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:19,638
It's more like, you know, drawing a map

429
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:23,358
of Iran and also trying to keep.

430
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,510
Be mindful of all the activities and political things

431
00:20:26,511 --> 00:20:28,750
that has happened in the past 10 years and

432
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:31,110
trying to cover that in this one map.

433
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:33,308
So it's a big project, and I want.

434
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:34,556
I want to do that.

435
00:20:34,557 --> 00:20:36,676
Yeah, that sounds really exciting.

436
00:20:36,677 --> 00:20:41,500
Talking about history, is there any episode that you

437
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:44,932
particularly like from last year, from the PyPodcats?

438
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:47,724
I mean, the episode that stays a lot in my mind

439
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:52,228
is the one with Vicky, so I really like that. Yeah.

440
00:20:52,229 --> 00:20:56,556
And I also like the one that I.

441
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:57,580
Maybe I.

442
00:20:57,581 --> 00:20:59,708
I'm sorry if I mispronounce her name.

443
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:04,524
Was it Isabel from Real Python?

444
00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:05,884
Joanna.

445
00:21:05,885 --> 00:21:08,060
Joanna. Sorry, it was Joanna. I'm sorry. Yes.

446
00:21:08,061 --> 00:21:10,396
Joanna from Real Python. Yeah. Yes.

447
00:21:10,397 --> 00:21:12,452
Yeah, yeah. Because I.

448
00:21:12,453 --> 00:21:14,300
I think that was also really nice

449
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:17,204
because it Was for me, she's. She.

450
00:21:17,205 --> 00:21:19,052
I didn't know her before the podcast

451
00:21:19,053 --> 00:21:20,964
and I was like, whoa, really?

452
00:21:20,965 --> 00:21:23,060
I get to know a new person. That was.

453
00:21:23,061 --> 00:21:24,396
Yeah, that was really nice.

454
00:21:24,397 --> 00:21:26,108
And maybe it's my fault that I didn't

455
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:27,820
know her, but that was really nice.

456
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:29,928
I also didn't know her before the podcast.

457
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:31,360
This is something that.

458
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:34,880
The reason why we are doing this, it's because

459
00:21:34,881 --> 00:21:37,760
we know here and there among ourselves, we know

460
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:40,176
people that is doing amazing work and they have

461
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:41,940
been quiet for a long time.

462
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,072
And I guess most female usually feel like

463
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:49,280
what they do is not that big.

464
00:21:49,281 --> 00:21:52,400
So they're just like, well, we don't think we

465
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:55,060
are good enough to just talk about it.

466
00:21:55,061 --> 00:22:00,260
So this podcast is the best way to talk more

467
00:22:00,261 --> 00:22:03,172
about these people and let people know who they are.

468
00:22:03,173 --> 00:22:03,676
Yes.

469
00:22:03,677 --> 00:22:05,892
And also, Joanna just won

470
00:22:05,893 --> 00:22:09,316
the Community Service award recently.

471
00:22:09,317 --> 00:22:10,220
Yes. Yeah.

472
00:22:10,221 --> 00:22:11,020
Yeah.

473
00:22:11,021 --> 00:22:13,852
And also, I mean, I remember

474
00:22:13,853 --> 00:22:16,596
also another episode with Jessica. She was,

475
00:22:16,597 --> 00:22:17,964
I mean she is inspiring.

476
00:22:17,965 --> 00:22:20,480
I mean, I watched that episode, so. Whoa.

477
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,950
I mean, that's amazing.

478
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,266
Yeah, that was an amazing episode as well.

479
00:22:26,267 --> 00:22:30,490
Yeah, I'm glad that it really inspired.

480
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:34,298
It's kind of a feedback that what we need.

481
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:37,882
I mean, soon you are part of us now.

482
00:22:37,883 --> 00:22:39,738
So soon you'll be asking around

483
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:41,802
like, what feedback do you get?

484
00:22:41,803 --> 00:22:44,634
What do you want to hear more or things like that?

485
00:22:44,635 --> 00:22:46,506
I think if anybody wants to get a

486
00:22:46,507 --> 00:22:52,158
whole more comprehensive a overview of what happened

487
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,262
last year in PyPodcats, Mariatta wrote a blog

488
00:22:55,263 --> 00:22:58,054
post about it which is on our website.

489
00:22:58,055 --> 00:23:01,126
And you can see you can have in one place

490
00:23:01,127 --> 00:23:03,670
links to all the episodes and you can catch up

491
00:23:03,671 --> 00:23:07,126
to all the seven guests that we had last year.

492
00:23:07,127 --> 00:23:09,270
This year we are also planning to do.

493
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:11,798
We are planning to do eight episodes or so.

494
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:14,246
Yeah, we'll continue to work on all the

495
00:23:14,247 --> 00:23:17,350
episodes and there'll be a lot more new

496
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:20,140
faces that you've never heard before.

497
00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:25,164
And I think Cheuk has also written another

498
00:23:25,165 --> 00:23:28,892
blog post about our plans for the 2025.

499
00:23:28,893 --> 00:23:31,500
Apart from that, we have also set

500
00:23:31,501 --> 00:23:35,196
up a new Open Collective account on.

501
00:23:35,197 --> 00:23:38,876
The platform that is for figuring out if you

502
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:43,360
want to support the podcast and fund us, because

503
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,716
I think this year we are not,

504
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:47,988
so last year we were funded

505
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:49,866
by The PSF, which was amazing.

506
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:53,146
And this year we probably won't.

507
00:23:53,147 --> 00:23:56,642
So that's why we are reaching to the community.

508
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,210
If you want to contribute, we

509
00:23:58,211 --> 00:23:59,930
have an Open Collective.

510
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:02,906
And you can see in the also in the

511
00:24:02,907 --> 00:24:05,602
in the kickoff blog post how to do that.

512
00:24:05,603 --> 00:24:08,802
And also on our website we will post a link as well.

513
00:24:08,803 --> 00:24:09,578
Yep.

514
00:24:09,579 --> 00:24:13,570
You can actually check out on pypodcats.live.

515
00:24:13,571 --> 00:24:15,346
That's where our website and

516
00:24:15,347 --> 00:24:18,166
all the information will be.

517
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:20,890
I mean it is quite surprising, I think we.

518
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,730
There's a lot of tooling going on

519
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:29,318
running a podcast that is so distributed. Right.

520
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:31,702
So yeah, we need like, we need a

521
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:37,286
calendar system that makes it easier, otherwise we

522
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:39,630
would have insane amount of messages.

523
00:24:39,631 --> 00:24:43,230
We need a streaming platform, we need for

524
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:48,806
subtitles, something for video editing, social media platform.

525
00:24:48,807 --> 00:24:52,670
And in the end, all of them, each of them is not

526
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:55,470
like a lot of money, but somehow they all add up.

527
00:24:55,471 --> 00:24:56,942
None of them comes free.

528
00:24:56,943 --> 00:24:57,230
No.

529
00:24:57,231 --> 00:24:58,958
None of them comes in the email

530
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:02,310
account and the name in the DNS.

531
00:25:02,311 --> 00:25:07,046
The namespace and also what you donate.

532
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,766
It's not going to be our salary, so

533
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:13,178
we are still going to be volunteers.

534
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:17,258
And sometimes we also had it like if our guest

535
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:21,706
does not actually have access to a good technical setup.

536
00:25:21,707 --> 00:25:26,642
We did send microphone or headphones, so.

537
00:25:26,643 --> 00:25:29,386
We do support them technically.

538
00:25:29,387 --> 00:25:33,530
I want to say that everything is transparent

539
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,890
and I think you can also read about

540
00:25:35,891 --> 00:25:37,394
the expenses in the blog post.

541
00:25:37,395 --> 00:25:38,742
So it's.

542
00:25:38,743 --> 00:25:41,566
We try to be as transparent as

543
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:43,830
it can be, which is great sometimes.

544
00:25:43,831 --> 00:25:46,542
Yeah, I mean sometimes we might forget something,

545
00:25:46,543 --> 00:25:51,166
but usually we will be as transparent as. As we can.

546
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:51,478
Yeah.

547
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:54,286
I mean it's also interesting if anybody's ever interested in

548
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:56,830
running their own podcast to see a little bit what

549
00:25:56,831 --> 00:25:59,486
would be the costs behind it to understand a little

550
00:25:59,487 --> 00:26:01,822
bit what kind of finances they need to put down

551
00:26:01,823 --> 00:26:03,998
and what kind of tools are out there.

552
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:07,636
I was interviewed by one of podcast in Taiwan

553
00:26:07,637 --> 00:26:11,820
last year and they were talking about the PyPodcats

554
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,916
and they thought that we are like a whole

555
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:17,276
team of like 10 or 15 people.

556
00:26:17,277 --> 00:26:20,480
No, it's just Georgi working a lot.

557
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,040
Mariatta is also working.

558
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,680
So what you see is what you get.

559
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,164
There's only the four or five of us now.

560
00:26:31,165 --> 00:26:32,668
There's nothing more.

561
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:33,108
So yeah.

562
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:35,204
So if you want to have all of this information, it's

563
00:26:35,205 --> 00:26:37,380
on, on our blog site and today we are

564
00:26:37,381 --> 00:26:40,962
eeally happy to have this session to introduce

565
00:26:40,963 --> 00:26:43,370
Mojdeh and to tell you about last year

566
00:26:43,371 --> 00:26:45,674
a little bit, but very a little bit and also

567
00:26:45,675 --> 00:26:47,882
a little bit more about the outlook for next year.

568
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:51,274
And we already have the plan for the first

569
00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:54,990
recording this month, which will probably drop next month.

570
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,990
