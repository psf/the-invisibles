1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,920
I have to find a job.

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,920
Funniest  part was the first screening calls.

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,520
You get really weird questions.

4
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,360
That's like what is the expected salary

5
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,240
range? Why do you need so much money?

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,960
I think I tried almost all.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,680
I was only mentioning that I didn't try PhD yet.

8
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,720
Working for myself, working for someone

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,600
else, starting my own company, growing my

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,360
own company, selling my own company.

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,520
My first job in the Netherlands was an

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,600
executive director.

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,640
You working with people online.

14
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,080
People were surprised to know that I'm

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,800
female.

16
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,400
Somehow they were expecting just, you know,

17
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,280
another guy like who are you? I was like,

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:38,840
I'm

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,760
your engineer, you know,

20
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,440
I was working with self driving trucks.

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,880
And after that I jump on getting back to

22
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,840
more like maritime industry and I switched

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,160
to working with aircrafts.

24
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,640
How much food should we put in it? How much water,

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,720
how much fuel? I have heard in my previous

26
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,120
job that a lot of air traffic planning is

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,040
using Prolog.

28
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,400
Is that true when the aircraft is flying

29
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,680
the ATC just passing it from one chunk of

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,640
cubes to another chunk of cubes

31
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,320
I'm Una from PyLadies Amsterdam and if

32
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,120
you're interested to learn what is the

33
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,360
connection between cubes in the air

34
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,680
sensor fusion and

35
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,640
going from nothing to something then listen

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,520
to this PyPodcats
