00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,600
Hello everyone and welcome to the Pypodcatsyes

2
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,200
for our Hidden Figures of Python

3
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,980
series today our guest is Mona Obedoza

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,230
and if this is your first time you're

5
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,480
listening to the 

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,300
Pypodcats

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,390
you're probably wondering what the

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,510
PyPodcats are we are highlighting the voices

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,790
of underrepresented group members in the

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,470
Python community we have a code of conduct

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,310
which is the PSF the Python Software

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,270
Foundation code of conduct and we follow it

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,620
to help our interactions and keep Python

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,630
positive successful and growing community

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,700
and I am Tereza

16
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,940
I am based in Hamburg

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,270
and with us we have our other co-host

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,060
Georgi based in

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,830
Hi everyone my name is Georgi and I'm

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,100
coming from

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,640
I'm not coming from I'm based

22
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,630
I'm based in Amsterdam I'm coming from my

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,710
mother's womb but I'm based in the

24
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,780
Netherlands

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,460
so

26
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,590
we are in a mood today because both Georgi

27
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,500
and I are in

28
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,350
there's public holidays around here both in

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,230
Germany and Netherlands so it's a free day

30
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,150
it's sunny outside we're not used to this weather

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,420
 so it gets to our head

32
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,400
so Mona would you like to do a little quick

33
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,220
introduction

34
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,820
about who you are

35
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,510
yes absolutely hello everyone my name is

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,910
Mona Obedoza I'm a high school student from

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,270
the Philippines and I study at Stanford

38
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,590
online high school I really love to code

39
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,350
I'm an inspiring artificial intelligence

40
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,270
engineer and because of that my advocacy is

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,110
also teaching other kids how to code and 

42
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,310
to this end i'm also a student ambassador

43
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,670
for women in AI I'm the co-leader of the

44
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,783
Girls can Code club at my school and I'm

45
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,490
the founder of the Purposeful Mochii which is

46
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,550
a little organization I started locally

47
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,916
that holds workshops and hackathons to

48
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:11,630
teach kids how to code

49
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,986
That's very interesting Mona because I 

50
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:18,136
remember I saw you the first time when you 

51
00:02:18,146 --> 00:02:20,340
attended one of the events

52
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,550
in Python Philippines and that triggered me

53
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,430
like whoa this girl and this young age has

54
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,990
started coding and knowing way more than

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,350
what I know already so I was totally

56
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,950
impressed to be honest and (thank you) I was like one

57
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,260
day I'm just gonna

58
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,430
approach and know a little bit more about

59
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,980
this little Mona here so how do you started

60
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,070
learning how to code and doing all the

61
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,100
programming

62
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,070
I started learning how to code around the

63
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,990
time I graduated from kinder I was maybe

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,920
around five years old my mom was a software

65
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,240
engineer at the time and so

66
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,190
he downloaded this app and it was like the

67
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,470
simple logic based game where like you

68
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,430
instruct a dinosaur to move in a certain

69
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,840
way and follow and like

70
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,790
use that to complete certain puzzles and it

71
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,910
was meant to teach me the basics of coding

72
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,910
and logic and that kind of thing and I was

73
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,500
just absolutely obsessed with it I

74
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,430
just played it for a very long time I think I

75
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,310
finished it in like one night and because

76
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,510
of that she let me move on to more advanced

77
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,760
programming languages such as

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,670
well I started blockbase fielding languages

79
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,830
like Tynker and then Scratch and then

80
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,950
because I couldn't get enough of that

81
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,910
either I eventually in around third grade

82
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,100
I moved on to

83
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,310
do text based programming with Python of

84
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,270
being my very first text based programming

85
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,680
language

86
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,710
after that I started learning more things

87
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,360
like HTML, CSS, Javascript, some mobile app

88
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,750
development with App Inventor and recently

89
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,630
I started taking classes at my school also

90
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,550
and because of that I also learned C++ and Java

91
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,340
Holy Moly

92
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,040
yeah so you know a lot of programming

93
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,060
languages which one is your favorite?

94
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,470
I think Python is definitely the one that's

95
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,230
closest to my heart as I said it's one of

96
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,960
the very first ones that I ever tried and

97
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,460
I remember that when I was a kid it

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,840
was really my favorite programming language to

99
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,350
do I would always try to make different

100
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,950
games with it and I had this little Python

101
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,780
book of games that I would always use

102
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,220
and even today when

103
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,750
when I work on some projects I always use

104
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,550
Python for Data Science, Artificial

105
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,350
Intelligence because it just has so many

106
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,990
libraries that are very well documented and

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,390
make it very easy to get started with all

108
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,020
of those things and even

109
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,190
when I teach kids how to code I think

110
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,950
Python is a really great language to get

111
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,510
started with because it's not too complex

112
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,230
you don't need to remember brackets and

113
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,420
that kind of thing in this kind of like

114
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,070
it's very simple and easy to pick up and

115
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,040
it's a really good way to bridge the gap

116
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,110
between block based programming and early

117
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,950
logic puzzles and data programming

118
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,510
languages as well wait a second because I just wrote down

119
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,590
 here something because of your first 

120
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,070
game being with dinosaurs do you also have

121
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,860
 a special

122
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,220
affinity towards dinosaurs?

123
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,350
Actually I am very scared of dinosaurs I

124
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,670
refused to watch dinosaur movies it

125
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,590
scares me a lot but it's just that in that

126
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,660
particular game it was

127
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,430
a very cute little chirpy dinosaur and so I

128
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,430
just loved it a lot

129
00:04:54,873 --> 00:04:56,980
But then in real life dinosaurs scare me

130
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,590
yeah I mean it's just birds that are still

131
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,310
around us right I mean the other ones are

132
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,020
all dead

133
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,793
it's very unnerving

134
00:05:04,793 --> 00:05:05,460
so you're safe

136
00:05:06,526 --> 00:05:09,380
and actually Tereza is reviving them

137
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,980
oh my gosh

138
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,790
yeah I'm just putting them on paintings

139
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,480
it's fine it's made up dinosaur so it's

140
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,360
it's fine cute perfectI hope I hope it stays that way

141
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,200
so

142
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,630
just curious like why do you like Python

143
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,750
more is it really because of like the

144
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,520
language or are you drawn to the community

145
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,020
or what's the reason why you actually

146
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,340
prefer Python

147
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,470
it's really a little bit of both language

148
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,630
is honestly just so great it's really a

149
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,850
great way to get started with

150
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,060
 programming in general get started with 

151
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,063
fundamentals before having to worry about 

152
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:43,720
complicated syntax and that kind of thing

153
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,900
and it also

154
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,030
makes really easy to get started with more

155
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,950
complicated topics like Data Science, AI and

156
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,470
alike but at the same time I also really

157
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,950
love the Python community I think the

158
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,750
Python community is really where I

159
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,750
started my whole journey I remember you

160
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,020
mentioned that you saw me at

161
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,150
an event several years ago here in Python

162
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,040
Philippines and

163
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,040
ithatwas probably

164
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,870
actually that was my very first speaking

165
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,830
engagement i remember i just joined the

166
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,550
Python tech conference because I loved

167
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,070
programming in Python I wanted to learn more

168
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,740
more and I found out that

169
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,020
they were having

170
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,870
lightning talks and so I decided you know

171
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,630
why not I might as well let's just see where

172
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,780
that takes me

173
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,750
and so yeah that was my very first speaking

174
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,510
engagement and even though I was only

175
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,230
around perhaps 10 years old or something

176
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,110
like that at the time they were all very

177
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,710
supportive of me I was so nervous to be

178
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,030
speaking in front of such a big crowd for the

179
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,070
very first time but they were all so

180
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,350
supportive and so engaged in my

181
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,350
presentation and they really made me feel

182
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,150
welcomed and appreciated and yeah clearly

183
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,310
what gave me the confidence to try other

184
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,470
speaking opportunities, try signing up for

185
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,550
summer camps schools and that kind of thing

186
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,180
where I could learn how to code

187
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,190
and improve my coding skills as well and

188
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,020
get more involved with the tech community

189
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,700
that's really cool

190
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,590
so you mentioned you got involved also in

191
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,390
the Python community what do you do in the

192
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,920
Python community currently

193
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,030
Generally I still do some speaking

194
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,830
engagements I think I've been invited to a

195
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,060
few speaking engagements in the past like

196
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,550
I've done a talk at the PyLadiesCon also at

197
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,230
the most recent PyCon and generally I speak

198
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,990
about my advocacy which is teaching kids

199
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,100
how to code

200
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,110
and I also and I also speak about my

201
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,510
organization the Purposeful Mochii which

202
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,870
does exactly that and I speak about some of

203
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,830
the AI projects I do as well

204
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,696
so tell us a little bit more about how you 

205
00:07:17,696 --> 00:07:20,176
teach younger people to code like the kids or

206
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:21,880
because

207
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,580
it passed our

208
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,590
our level you see so we are in the

209
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,100
adulthood so you

210
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,730
 are still like in between you know I mean 

211
00:07:30,913 --> 00:07:32,840
so I'm really interested on

212
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,220
actually teach the kids code

213
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,190
right well I started the Purposeful Mochii

214
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,590
when I was pretty young and it was just

215
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,270
kind of like doing little coding workshops

216
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,240
for my friends because

217
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,270
we didn't really have coding lessons at my

218
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,550
school at the time because we were very

219
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,190
young and so I decided it would be fun to

220
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,670
just teach my friends how to code and so we

221
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,350
had little gatherings and coffee shops and

222
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,270
that kind of thing but eventually I decided

223
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,710
to take that further I started doing

224
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,310
workshops with larger groups of people I

225
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,510
didn't know and also younger age groups as

226
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,750
well and then most recently I partnered

227
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,430
with Accenture Philippines for the Breaking

228
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,150
Barriers Building Bridges Hackathon for

229
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,910
Girls here in the Philippines where

230
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,760
basically girls of

231
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,110
any level of experience with coding really

232
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,630
can come join in teams of around three or

233
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,420
four and

234
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,350
start learning how to solve problems using code

235
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,630
I think that hackathons are really my

236
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,270
preferred way of teaching kids how to code

237
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,310
because well first of all it's very

238
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,030
important more important than just learning

239
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,390
how to code it's also important to learn

240
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,270
how to use technology to solve problems and

241
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,630
that's exactly what hackathons are all

242
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,510
about you pick a problem and make a project

243
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,780
to try and solve it

244
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,360
second I also think that this improves this

245
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,910
increases their confidence a lot because when

246
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,470
 you join a hackathon and you make a project

247
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,590
 that can solve a real world problem

248
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,110
at the very end you're able to take a step back

249
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,870
 and think wow I was able to create all

250
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,350
of this stuff I think it really improves

251
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,760
their confidence a lot and I think

252
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,920
and so that's generally what the Purposeful 

253
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,750
Mochii has been focusing on its efforts on

254
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,270
lately doing hackathons and things like

255
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,270
that where kids can get started with coding

256
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,070
and find out all of the amazing things that

257
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,830
technology can do / Are you doing this all

258
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,420
alone or do you have other people helping you out? 

259
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,870
I have some people helping me out so I have

260
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,950
this one I have this one friend who helps

261
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,710
me out with the Purposeful Mochii as well

262
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,350
and we just collaborate sometimes in teaching

263
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,220
workshops and in reaching more kids

264
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,710
and aside from that I also partnered with

265
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,630
tech companies such as Accenture like I

266
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,200
mentioned and also with the Python

267
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,360
community sometimes

268
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,013
and to seek more supportyou know that's at another level

269
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:21,710
because you are actually getting the

270
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,060
 companies involved

271
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,820
 at your age like how do you actually

272
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,353
 approach them?

273
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,000
well actually

274
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,820
well I think it just

275
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,110
it all started really when I just had that first

276
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,150
experience at the Python tech conference

277
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,070
and I started making connections meeting

278
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,670
new people and then because of that I

279
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,310
started being invited to more and more

280
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,230
things and because of that I ended up just

281
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,830
meeting more and more people who I'm able

282
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,990
to reach out to whenever I have an event 

283
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,350
Like I get to reach out to them and ask hey

284
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,790
do you want to be a guest speaker for this 

285
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,710
event and help inspire these kids and that 

286
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,540
sort of thing so it's really just all about

287
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,440
all of the

288
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,270
conferences that I like going to and

289
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,460
speaking at and making connections through there

290
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,680
interesting

291
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,790
to be honest because I do have kids too and

292
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,560
a lot of young people some of them they

293
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,660
feel like coding is not cool

294
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,550
so it's not easy to trigger them to pick up

295
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,780
this because

296
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,400
it

297
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,550
gives them a perception that it's actually

298
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,670
hard or like it seems to be that the

299
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,200
learning curve is higher than other things

300
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,160
so how do you actually make it

301
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,550
accessible or make it interesting to

302
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,270
younger people to learn how code

303
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:26,860
I can absolutely

304
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,510
relate to that most of the time when I was

305
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,220
really young

306
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,200
and

307
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,870
a lot of the people i would talk to would

308
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,240
think that coding was really hard and

309
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,470
then coding and math and science and

310
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,030
especially girls they would really think

311
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,980
that it was really difficult and that's why

312
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,180
in my workshops usually I get started with

313
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,773
very simple things like block based coding

314
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,110
languages starting with Scratch for desktop

315
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,670
and game development they're thunkable for

316
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,470
mobile development to teach them that it's

317
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,833
really not that scary at all it's just 

318
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,950
doing some logic and putting stuff

319
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,190
together and eventually you're going to end

320
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,070
up with this project and you're going to be

321
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,000
like wow how did I

322
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,600
do all of this it actually wasn't

323
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,180
that tough after all

324
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,790
and I think there's a misconception that

325
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,830
programming is all very technical stuff

326
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,470
algorithms match etc it's like wow I don't

327
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,910
want to have all these particles swimming

328
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,020
around in my head

329
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,270
but in actuality the programming is all

330
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,910
about you know logic creative thinking and

331
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,790
that sort of thing and that's why through

332
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,350
hackathons and workshops and that kind of

333
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,470
thing where i get started with very simple

334
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,590
programming languages and games and stuff

335
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,030
to begin with I hope to instill that

336
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,590
impression that coding is actually

337
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,070
something that can be fun yeah but I think

338
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,160
that misconception came out also from

339
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,150
larger companies who had the whole phase of

340
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,980
job interviews being algorithm cracking

341
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,200
so

342
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,430
you have to know all the algorithms by

343
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,670
heart and everything and that it was like

344
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,950
the only way to get through the door 

345
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,630
and think that it's something that 

346
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,910
there's a whole generation affected by that

347
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,470
 thinking although they go in the job and

348
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,550
 then they don't apply any of the algorithms

349
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,940
so that's very true yeah

350
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,350
but in reality the real job does not really

351
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,620
encompass what the interview goes through

352
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,430
it's true it's true I mean for you perhaps

353
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,590
not a level yet but I'm pretty sure you'll

354
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,280
be hired by some big company soon but I think

355
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,230
that's kind of like what Tereza has

356
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,030
mentioned is a very interesting issue here

357
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,640
that in the tech industry they tend to over

358
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,860
test

359
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,240
yeah

360
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,420
it's just

361
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,470
testing on a different aspect that is then

362
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,080
not really connected to the world and also

363
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,830
nowadays we have so so many technologies

364
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,710
and so many aids you don't really need to

365
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,950
learn exactly like what to do

366
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,960
yeah and it's probably exactly how Mona is designing her

367
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,190
courses in the end is like putting things

368
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,780
together and getting something done

369
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,140
yep absolutely that's why

370
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,230
I like doing hackathon so that they can

371
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,710
actually experience what it's actually like

372
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,630
to program a project instead of just

373
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,750
programming like a simple like some kind of

374
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,270
mathematical thing they actually program a

375
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,550
project that has a practical use and so you

376
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,990
get to experience all the stuff where

377
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,550
you're trying to come up with you're trying

378
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,220
to come up with creative solutions and you

379
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,720
end up like spending a lot of time

380
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,590
debugging but also spending a lot of time

381
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,550
designing things, ideating, brainstorming and

382
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,670
that sort of thing and all of the things

383
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,916
that make that make coding a technology button

384
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,260
 are your courses then also available

385
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,280
online for like kids all over the world or

386
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,820
going to be available online?

387
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,360
well so far

388
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,070
I haven't done anything about releasing

389
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,710
courses myself with the Purposeful Mochii

390
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,150
although we do do some workshops and

391
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,510
they're mostly live workshop but as far as coding

392
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:32,856
 courses go I remember that when I was young

393
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:34,803
 I did a few things on Khan Academy I think 

394
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,723
and also generally what helped me a lot was

395
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,210
 getting programming books I had this book

396
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,240
 of like how to make

397
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,150
several like I don't know around 40 like

398
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,806
simple sketch games and I would follow it

399
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,516
and I would make a lot of Scatch games and

400
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,063
 then I had one also with Python and it 

401
00:13:46,063 --> 00:13:47,240
taught me how to make

402
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,073
 If Conditions for example by making choose

403
00:13:49,073 --> 00:13:51,020
 your own adventure games or how to do 

404
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,083
For Loops by doing alien invasion games so that 

405
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,883
kind of thing and that's really what got me 

406
00:13:54,893 --> 00:13:55,740
interested in

407
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,780
coding

408
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,940
so games is the keyno dinosaur yeah and not dinosaurs I just

409
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,040
 I just didn't get any dinosaurs sorry

410
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,323
okay but I just realized there is one instance in

411
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:08,076
which I like dinosaurs which is like the Chrome

412
00:14:08,076 --> 00:14:09,663
 dinosaur game you know the one where you keep on

413
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:11,263
hitting space bars and there's no internet

414
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:12,120
 

415
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,600
Google

416
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,390
I understand that you started coding like

417
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,780
really young you mentioned once to me like 

418
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,566
five years old yeah she mentioned like yes I think I said that

419
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,450
so does looking young and being smaller 

420
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,470
help people interact with you do you feel

421
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,230
intimidated sometimes if like people who

422
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,710
try to like you know older people start to

423
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,910
talk to you or things like that about the

424
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,043
knowledge and or at you

425
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,583
yeah exactly

426
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,470
actually there are really pros and cons to being into being

427
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,460
small and cute

428
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,580
when I go to tech conferences

429
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,400
well

430
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,790
sometimes I feel really nervous like when I

431
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,430
am about to go up in front like oh my gosh

432
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,950
 all of these people have so much more

433
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,230
experience than me they're so much older

434
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,380
than me what could I possibly teach them

435
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,760
but that's why I guess I'm just so grateful

436
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,230
that communities here are just super

437
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,790
supportive like the Python community for

438
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,620
example

439
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,070
they never look down at me or anything like

440
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,030
that they've always supported me and

441
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,100
invited me

442
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,990
to speak at the tech conferences and help

443
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,220
me out whenever I have a big event going on

444
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,590
and also being young also makes it easier

445
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,830
for me to talk to kids I guess especially

446
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,550
when I teach workshops and when I hold

447
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,510
hackathons I guess it helps me relate to

448
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,110
them more and come up with activities that

449
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,190
they would find fun and at the same time it

450
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
feels like being young kind of inspires

451
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,190
them if I can do all of these things then

452
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,340
so can they I guess

453
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,470
have you experienced being taught in the

454
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,110
more traditional way coding did anybody try

455
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,150
to teach you coding and he's like here's a

456
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,510
programming book let's go through it page

457
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,580
by page or that's right

458
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,720
20 programs and then you know how to code style

459
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,110
I got most of my coding lessons at Stanford

460
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,550
online high school where I currently study

461
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,350
and it's honestly that's actually part of

462
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,000
what made coding so fun for me too 

463
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,820
the way that they approached teaching is

464
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,790
really cool and even when they do have to

465
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,186
teach fundamental things like algorithms

466
00:16:01,206 --> 00:16:02,190
 like the math behind it like the hardware 

467
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,710
behind it they do it in such a way where it's 

468
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,423
easy for me to understand what's going on 

469
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,310
by drawing it out on the screen and showing

470
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,716
it step by step and it really just makes me 

471
00:16:10,726 --> 00:16:12,136
realize that in the end all of it is just

472
00:16:12,146 --> 00:16:13,643
 about logic that's really the most 

473
00:16:13,643 --> 00:16:15,263
important part developing that logic and

474
00:16:15,273 --> 00:16:16,906
 critical thinking skills after you've done

475
00:16:16,913 --> 00:16:18,410
 that it's easy to pick up any language

476
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,136
 regardless of the syntax and it's easy to

477
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,630
 understand the algorithms and all of that

478
00:16:21,673 --> 00:16:22,870
 so it's really all about building that

479
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,900
 strong foundation

480
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,653
have you actually tried different

481
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,360
 educational

482
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,270
books and like some of them actually kind

483
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,830
of like you couldn't get it and like when

484
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,510
it's exactly the same thing that you would

485
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,990
like to learn say for example maybe when

486
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,110
you just started to learn like machine

487
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,830
learning like other books that seem to

488
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,760
speak to you more than others or like

489
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,563
apps or anything seems to work better than the others

490
00:16:48,973 --> 00:16:50,353
 I think when I got started in machine

491
00:16:50,393 --> 00:16:52,080
 learning I used this website called Machine

492
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,550
 Learning for kids and the way it works is

493
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,230
 that it actually explains machine learning

494
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,310
to me in a very easy way because the way it 

495
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,460
works is that

496
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,670
you come up with categories called buckets

497
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,110
and then you put in examples in each

498
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,070
category and then after that you can deploy

499
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,830
it to a Scratch game or a Python game or

500
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,190
something like that and so I just had so

501
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,560
much fun with it when I was a kid after

502
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,516
school I would sit down 

503
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,460
and I would go to that site all the time and try out

504
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,330
all the different worksheets that they have

505
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,840
 and all the different programming projects

506
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,706
 that they have

507
00:17:16,006 --> 00:17:17,470
and so yeah I think it was really those

508
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,900
kinds of online resources

509
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,626
that really spoke to me a lot when I 

510
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,210
was growing up at the same time receiving a

511
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,096
 formal education in programming was also

512
00:17:25,173 --> 00:17:26,520
 really helpful for me because

513
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,230
you know I went online to learn all of the

514
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,030
practical things about coding but at the

515
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,123
same time it was also

516
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:34,043
 really important for me to go to school and learn

517
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,620
of the fundamentals going on behind it

518
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,220
maybe about that so I mean

519
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,910
you seem to have like your education is

520
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,030
like it's not just home you're not going

521
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,030
it's not very traditional in a sense like

522
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,670
you're going to school in a physical school

523
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,010
and probably the

524
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,010
 I guess the online aspect of it was 

525
00:17:53,076 --> 00:17:55,640
triggered by Covid or would that have been

526
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:57,136
 something that you would have planned

527
00:17:57,146 --> 00:17:58,640
 before the pandemic to

528
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,450
study on

529
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,616
 I actually go to an online school with

530
00:18:01,626 --> 00:18:03,063
 students from all around the world so I go

531
00:18:03,106 --> 00:18:04,490
 to Stanford Online High school and it's

532
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,840
 based in the US but we have

533
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,973
 folks from

534
00:18:07,273 --> 00:18:09,043
just here in Asia we have folks from Europe

535
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:10,876
 and different time zones and all of that

536
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:11,913
 and so that's why

537
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,470
 all of us are online and it was like

538
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,000
that even before the pandemic but I only

539
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,896
applied here after the pandemic and yeah we

540
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:19,660
really have a

541
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,430
different way of learning stuff and that's

542
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,390
why I'm also able to learn coding at such a

543
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,680
young age but then

544
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,390
over here coding isn't part of the basic

545
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,710
education curriculum yet and that's why

546
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,270
it's part of my advocacy to make it part of

547
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,990
that curriculum and you know expose kids

548
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,110
to coding at the early young age and 

549
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,680
of the opportunities that they don't have

550
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,840
yeah so cool how do you what do you do

551
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,220
 as part of your advocacy

552
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,910
movement do you go like also getting

553
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,560
involved in politics with politicians or

554
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,760
because this is

555
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,220
sorry I mean

556
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,780
the future of Mona

557
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,150
like if you go to a normal school and you 

558
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,750
say hey I want you to do something they're

559
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,870
gonna be like ah you have to write I don't

560
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,710
know how many forms, convince I don't know

561
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,870
how many people and all the children in the

562
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,390
school have to sign and all their parents

563
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,390
and their grandparents so

564
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,510
 I think that's kind of how it was when I 

565
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,740
wanted to change something in my school

566
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,070
no that's totally true though and that'swhat do you do?

567
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,630
why I partner with tech companies to make

568
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,550
things like I'm making various Building

569
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,310
Bridges Hackathons I partner with 

570
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,253
Accenture and that's why it's easier it's easier it's

571
00:19:20,253 --> 00:19:21,153
 easier to reach

572
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,790
more schools and you know to teach more kids

573
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,500
how to code

574
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,950
actually I've done some things with the

575
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,000
government for like

576
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,470
the DICT the Department of Information

577
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,310
Communications Technology once invited me

578
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,950
to do a little talk on Artificial

579
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,350
Intelligence for some of these students so it's

580
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,510
really hard finding to see how they're

581
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,580
implementing technology education already

582
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,190
on some government level I guess but

583
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,150
not part of the curriculum and that's why I

584
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,070
do have some personal projects in order to

585
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,670
make coding more accessible to kids and my

586
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,510
own and one of these projects actually is

587
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,750
this thing that I've been doing lately

588
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,800
called Mochii Ball Basic Algorithm earning

589
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,950
language and basically its goal is to

590
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,710
bridge digital divide and how public school

591
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,190
students learn how to code and the way it

592
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,160
works is that instead of using a computer

593
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,990
to write their code each student is given a

594
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,113
piece of paper where they can write down

595
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,646
where they can write down

596
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,670
their program basically and then after that

597
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,270
the teacher will just scan it and upload it

598
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,750
onto one computer and run it and that way

599
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,230
students will be able to see it come to life on

600
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,790
the digital screen but at the same time it's not 

601
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,406
the case that you need 40 computers for one 

602
00:20:18,406 --> 00:20:20,316
classroom you actually only need one for

603
00:20:20,326 --> 00:20:21,603
 the teacher and all of the students will

604
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:22,920
 write it down on paper so

605
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,990
you get that whole thing where you get to

606
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
see the code in action on your computer and get to 

607
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,070
think wow that's really cool and also go

608
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,790
through the debugging process but at the

609
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,430
same time it doesn't require that much

610
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,110
technical infrastructure making it more

611
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,840
accessible through public schools and rural

612
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,740
communities

613
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,270
hmm that's very interesting because that

614
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,030
actually solved the problem of having like

615
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,240
multiple laptops available in each

616
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,980
classroom so it kind of save cost

617
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,510
when I learned programming in school we had

618
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,190
programming class and we were learning

619
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,710
Pascal on whiteboards blackboards actually

620
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,590
back then but it was like you never knew

621
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,550
what was gonna happen if it was working or

622
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,990
not so you only relied on the teacher so

623
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,550
yeah and then I think that's cool with

624
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,550
Mona's project yes I think that's really something that I

625
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,863
 wanted to emphasize a lot with Mochii Ball

626
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:07,270
 because in traditional unplugged

627
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,950
 programming exercises where you write down

628
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,310
 stuff on paper usually you're not able to

629
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,110
see the output but then when I taught

630
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,460
 Mochii Ball at the

631
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,390
local public school I think the moment when

632
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,710
the magic happened for those kids was

633
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,043
really when

634
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,490
I uploaded the code onto the computer and 

635
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,550
they were able to watch it run and they

636
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,740
 were all like wow that's so cool and I 

637
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,510
think that's really one of the most

638
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,190
important moments in fair gaming when you

639
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,830
actually get something to work when you

640
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,310
actually see that Hello World printed for

641
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,790
the first time or you see something moving

642
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,310
on your screen for the first time and it's

643
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,673
like wow that's just so awesome you know

644
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:37,180
and it motivates people to like try it outyeah

645
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,880
yeah because I think

646
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,766
a lot of the developers spend a lot of time 

647
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:44,500
getting that to happen

648
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:48,900
the success has to happen

649
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,140
so that's called debugging

650
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,390
I hope that wouldn't demotivate a lot of

651
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,190
young people because it's just a daily part

652
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,140
of life

653
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,670
the debugging actually the debugging is

654
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,350
actually one of the fun parts because even

655
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,710
though it's super frustrating when you

656
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,550
can't get it to work it's always so relieving

657
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,920
when you finally see wow this area

658
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,040
was solved now it's a different error

659
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,380
that means I'm making progress and after

660
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,030
that one it's finally they finally actually

661
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,100
 worked it's just like oh my gosh I can sleep now

662
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,750
that's so so true I guess it happens to

663
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,990
every one of us it's like sometimes it

664
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,190
sounds just so easy and then sometimes it

665
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,110
just takes for hours and days you just

666
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,190
couldn't figure out what went wrong and then you just keep

667
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,280
tgoing back over and over and

668
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,230
over again the day you actually found out

669
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,420
what happened it was like wait what

670
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,690
why didn't I see that?

671
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,340
it's usually useful to sleep on it

672
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,190
yeah recently my friend was working on his

673
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,720
computer science project and

674
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,230
he was at it for like several hours only to

675
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,590
realize that the problem was that he used

676
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,680
two equal signs instead of one equal sign oh

677
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,640
right

678
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,150
sometimes two doesn't mean that it will be

679
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,140
extra sure

680
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,350
so I was just interested because you

681
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,990
mentioned about this project and I also

682
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,150
heard about your project TEDDY so you seem

683
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,900
to have a lot of projects going on oh yes absolutely

684
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,590
I would like to touch a little bit more, ask

685
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,390
a little bit more about project TEDDY but

686
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,520
before that can I ask how many projects are you

687
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,320
currently holding right now like well

688
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,910
I think I do a different I do a

689
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,590
different project every year because I like

690
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,390
joining tech competitions every year and

691
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,790
whenever there's a prompt and I have to

692
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,430
solve a problem for something it always

693
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,230
gets me thinking about how I can adjust it

694
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,990
and I end up having a new project every

695
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,150
year but I think the ones that are

696
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,100
like currently ongoing and that I'm currently

697
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,310
like well we actually made it past the prototype

698
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,786
stage in the recent years and I'm working 

699
00:23:50,786 --> 00:23:52,350
to take it further are TEDDY the Text Based 

700
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,516
Early Stress Detector for Youth which

701
00:23:54,526 --> 00:23:56,516
uses artificial intelligence to assess

702
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,670
 whether a student might have a mental

703
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,686
health concern and Mochii Ball the one I 

704
00:23:59,766 --> 00:24:01,216
was just talking about a while ago that's

705
00:24:01,226 --> 00:24:03,253
 aimed to help bridge the digital divide and

706
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,350
help public school students in learning how to code

707
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,420
I love this idea totally

708
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,360
yeah so now

709
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,660
so now tell us more about TEDDY

710
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,110
yes absolutely so TEDDY it's short for the

711
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,550
Text Based Early Distress Detector for

712
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,590
Youth and the way that it works is that you

713
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,953
upload an essay schools will upload an essay

714
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,630
 written by a student and then it's going to

715
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,083
 go through it line by line and use 

716
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,836
artificial intelligence to determine 

717
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,280
whether the student might be at risk for

718
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,950
 depression or self destructive thoughts and

719
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,640
that kind of thing so that school

720
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,880
counselors will be able to approach

721
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,460
students accordingly and so i guess

722
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,390
and yeah I guess the way that it works is

723
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,750
that it's able to help connect students who

724
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,110
are in need with counselors and help

725
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,760
counselors figure out which students they should

726
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,270
they should reach out to and that way

727
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,100
hopefully

728
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,110
prevent mental health concerns from

729
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,060
escalating

730
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,670
how did you come up with the idea

731
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,430
I know a couple of people in my community 

732
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,510
with mental health concerns who opened up

733
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,550
 to me about it and I guess that really 

734
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,480
inspired me to try and connect

735
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,270
them with the appropriate with the help

736
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,060
 that they need

737
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,230
in order to get through that I guess and I guess the

738
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,510
main problem with that is that

739
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,990
when people have mental health concerns

740
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,910
it's always it's always really challenging to try and

741
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,893
 reach out to the appropriate support and so

742
00:25:10,966 --> 00:25:13,050
 with TEDDY I hope to make it so that it's

743
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,890
easier for counselors to figure out which

744
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,516
 students to reach out to and to

745
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,296
 help give them the support that they need

746
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,603
 but then students need to actively opt in 

747
00:25:21,613 --> 00:25:24,230
for their data to be processed right to say

748
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,860
 like I want in case there's something that I need

749
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,420
yep absolutely

750
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,110
and that's why we've been trying to work

751
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,100
closely with schools

752
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,470
in order to work on those privacy concerns

753
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,700
and that sort of thing

754
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,980
when applying TEDDY 

755
00:25:37,213 --> 00:25:37,480
right

756
00:25:38,146 --> 00:25:40,150
I don't know much about the educational

757
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,710
system in the Philippines but do you have

758
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,920
like a counselor in every school or are they

759
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,830
set like you have to go by for appointment

760
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,820
or things like that for schools

761
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,910
yes we do have counselor for every school

762
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,070
and the problem really is that for one

763
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,560
counselor there are like hundreds of

764
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,420
students

765
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,080
who

766
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,500
they have to worry about and like

767
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,670
if they have to read the reflection papers

768
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,540
for example

769
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,710
by like several hundred students they're

770
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,630
probably going to miss a few who really

771
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,200
need help and

772
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,980
that's what TEDDY is for it's to

773
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,360
accelerate that process kind of using

774
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,750
artificial intelligence and basically show

775
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,660
which students

776
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,670
seem to be in most dire need of

777
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,270
 support of course that's still up to the counselor's

778
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,870
judgment in the end because human judgment

779
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,300
is of course really important

780
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,710
in these kinds of situations especially

781
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,460
when actually talking to the student that's

782
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,660
where the counselors really come in but

783
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,460
with TEDDY hopefully it will make it a lot easier

784
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,636
 to identify which students need help

785
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,060
 Have you actually tested this pilot yet or

786
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,616
Yep we have tested it at my school we

787
00:26:43,626 --> 00:26:45,209
 surveyed a bunch of people and had them

788
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:46,920
 write some essays and then

789
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,350
after that what we did is that we ran them through

790
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,843
 TEDDY and then put the results there and

791
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,470
 then we also asked the counselors like


795
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,920
to verify whether TEEDY was accurate or not

796
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,790
and it was actually really accurate even

797
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,590
some essays that look like they were just

798
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,070
about regular innocent topics like

799
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,740
superheroes or that kind of thing

800
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,310
and it didn't look like there was any

801
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,760
concern at all TEDDY was able to catch a

802
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,390
concern and the counselor confirmed that


805
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,930
so it proves that it's actually a very

806
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,283
 accurate technology 

807
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,416
did you ever have the situation where a

808
00:27:20,426 --> 00:27:21,480
 student is flagged

809
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,480
maybe having

810
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,950
some struggles but then the student denies

811
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,590
having the struggles like they do not want

812
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,560
to be labeled like that is that also

813
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,876
something happening

814
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,410
 I'm actually not sure we weren't able to

815
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,230
take TEDDY that far in my school yet and

816
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,350
that's why and that's why we've also been

817
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,790
looking for more schools that we can

818
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,350
partner with in our day to get TEDDY out

819
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,310
there and try out these kinds of situations

820
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,190
have you ever thought of like expanding

821
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,590
this project like worldwide to other

822
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,810
schools around the world ?

823
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,410
yes absolutely the team that worked on 

824
00:27:51,476 --> 00:27:53,323
TEDDY or other students in my school a lot

825
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:54,830
 of them are actually the rest of them are

826
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,050
from the US and so they've also been trying

827
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,636
 it out in schools in the US and like

828
00:27:59,646 --> 00:28:01,160
schools that they're aware of in the us and

829
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,770
we'll see where it takes us 

830
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,430
so what's the hurdles that you have to

831
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,323
jump for this project right now? 

832
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:11,593
the main thing is finding a school that's

833
00:28:11,593 --> 00:28:12,960
 willing to work with us I guess

834
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,830
that's why it's actually good that I'm

835
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,590
able to bring up TEDDY during this podcast

836
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,620
because hopefully

837
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,710
if anyone is interested in reaching out and

838
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,380
then trying to pilot TEDDY in their school

839
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,180
or in our community or in our community

840
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,950
TEDDY is available at teddy-technovation.streamlit.app

841
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,750
 teddy-technovation.streamlit.app and so if you want to 

842
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,430
go check it out and then leave us a message

843
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,990
if you would be interested in piloting it

844
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,900
and exploring it further

845
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:35,200
 is there a specific age group like for 

846
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,880
TEDDY or any

847
00:28:37,206 --> 00:28:38,780
any schools like

848
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,140
universities 

849
00:28:40,573 --> 00:28:43,540
high schools primary schools everything is 

850
00:28:43,646 --> 00:28:44,600
applicable ?

851
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,733
theoretically

852
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:47,510
we're hoping to expand it to everyone not

853
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,510
just schools but also workplaces as well

854
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,470
but right now we're mostly focusing on high

855
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,240
school students because actually though

856
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,250
that's kind of data that we collected and we're

857
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:55,116
working with

858
00:28:55,126 --> 00:28:56,663
maybe it would work out also for the 

859
00:28:56,706 --> 00:28:58,140
PyLadies community

860
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,520
maybehmm

861
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,300
yeah

862
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,910
it could be like it could run as a PyLadies

863
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,710
workshop and then everybody writes a short

864
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,900
essay and then sees it in action

865
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,860
okay this is

866
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,580
and then you're like

867
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,470
I don't know what the labels that are

868
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,420
coming out of

869
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,060
surprise

870
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,220
99 percent

871
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,340
everybody's depressed

872
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,990
everybody's struggling everybody's getting

873
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,700
a burn off yeah

874
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,260
tech world so I think

875
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,870
yeah interesting for grown ups it's 

876
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,320
quite

877
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,660
different data set yeah

878
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,080
I think that there is actually a big issue

879
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,830
related to mental health especially for the

880
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,680
tech industry

881
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,820
workers

882
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:47,840
which is

883
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,233
developers and programmers included so it's

884
00:29:51,266 --> 00:29:53,316
 something that unlike health

885
00:29:53,593 --> 00:29:56,360
 like physical health problems it's really hard to

886
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,150
identify yeah that's absolutely true with

887
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,600
physical health problems if you were

888
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,030
stabbed at something and you're bleeding

889
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,910
everyone will be able to see it but then

890
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,486
with mental health problems even if you're

891
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,586
you know even if it's if it's really reach to the 

892
00:30:07,613 --> 00:30:09,530
 crucial point already it's really it's really 

893
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,300
tough for other people to identify

894
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,996
I'm loving TEDDY so we should have this tagThank you

895
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:16,020
 line called I'm loving TEDDY

896
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,880
but I don't think it's just the tech

897
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,940
community I think it's everywhere

898
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:25,680
there's a lot of domains are facing changes

899
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,480
way faster than before and people are

900
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,540
getting you

901
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,510
know they feel unstable about their job 

902
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,910
insecure about their job situation and that 

903
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,060
affects them and everythingyeah yeah

904
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,550
I guess in our generation right

905
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,340
now it seems to be better than like 20

906
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,830
 years ago because it's almost unheard of 

907
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,750
mental health it's like no yeah it didn't exist 20 years ago right no

908
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,183
no no

909
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,460
everybody was healthy

910
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,310
yeah everyone's healthy and like say what's

911
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,630
wrong you just have to bite and 

912
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,900
get through this problem that's all 

913
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,400
man up

914
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,260
man up or like

915
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,360
get over it

916
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,960
yeah get over it like 

917
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,630
get yourself together don't be so sensitive

918
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,040
Georgi

919
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,100
yeah

920
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,510
another thing that I wanted to ask before

921
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,440
that was that your learning

922
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:15,940
journey

923
00:31:15,946 --> 00:31:18,470
because you did mention before that

924
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,030
your mother is also a software engineer so 

925
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,820
does that actually help you or does she 

926
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,740
actually like specifically gave you

927
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,140
games that's related to coding or you just self

928
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,830
picked it up and like get more interested

929
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,120
in programming you know what I mean 

930
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,666
oh yeah well she helped me out a lot really

931
00:31:38,673 --> 00:31:40,696
she was the one who decided to teach me

932
00:31:40,806 --> 00:31:42,103
 coding when I was really young and she

933
00:31:42,103 --> 00:31:43,920
 found this app and then she gave it to me 

934
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,870
and she also supported me all throughout my

935
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,430
journey when i expressed interest in it she

936
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,950
gave me books and that kind of thing she

937
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,500
connected me with opportunities

938
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,110
like hey there's this competition here that

939
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,630
you might want to try or this summer camp

940
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,430
that you might want to apply to and so all that 

941
00:31:55,506 --> 00:31:56,950
aside she's also really been my inspiration

942
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,300
all throughout i guess and

943
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,860
she's really my real model in life honestly

944
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,670
she also took me a few programming

945
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,540
fundamentals

946
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,486
and also and other STEM stuff when I

947
00:32:07,513 --> 00:32:09,040
was growing up I remember

948
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,150
yeah i remember we would usually sit down

949
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,630
and then she would teach me some things I

950
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,110
remember she was showing me when I was

951
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,600
really young how recursion worked and

952
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,190
writing down on a piece of paper so I

953
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,020
could follow along and so yeah she was really

954
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,060
because of that I really had the support

955
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,870
to learn more about programming and

956
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,630
technology and that's really what inspired

957
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,430
me to try and give that same kind of

958
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,150
support to other kids who don't necessarily

959
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,613
have that kind of background 

960
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,790
does she encourage you to do other things like other

961
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,920
hobbies or

962
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,030
like let you go let loose and just like try

963
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,660
everything Mona

964
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,430
yeah she does encourage me well she

965
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,236
encourages me not to stress so much about school and 

966
00:32:45,246 --> 00:32:46,576
extracurriculars and that kind of thing and

967
00:32:46,586 --> 00:32:48,300
 to play video games, reading books and do 

968
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,460
other and you know

969
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,510
just also have fun with my life and that

970
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,030
kind of thing programming is definitely

971
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,310
very fun but she also encourages me to let

972
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,700
loose and de-stress a lot

973
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,680
do you have any hobbies other than

974
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,220
well

975
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,740
than programming and learning

976
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,260
in school

977
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,190
which I guess for some people is not a

978
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,700
hobby but anyways

979
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,070
well let's see my hobbies I like reading

980
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,350
fantasy books lately I've been getting into

981
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,230
Brandon Sanderson's work and the Cosmere

982
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,620
Universe and the Stormlight Archive

983
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,980
I've been a really big fan of this lately

984
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,326
I've also been into I'm also watching 

985
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,860
Anime, reading manga

986
00:33:28,326 --> 00:33:30,790
and also listening to rock music and baking

987
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,620
chocolate chip cookies for my family

988
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,620
so maybe on our

989
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,080
podcast we can

990
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,310
share also for the first time a recipe do

991
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,150
you have a special recipe for the chocolate

992
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,366
chip cookies? is it like a recipe?

993
00:33:41,366 --> 00:33:42,333
oh yes I do have a recipe

994
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,183
oh my god okay cool 

995
00:33:44,183 --> 00:33:45,420
I don't know how to describe it

996
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,190
I don't know how to describe it on 

997
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,920
audio though I think it's just in a book

998
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,496
no no you you will send it to us you will

999
00:33:49,496 --> 00:33:52,846
send it to us we just put it on the web oh yes I will send it to you guyssend it to us and we post it on our website

1000
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,056
posted yes exactly it's going to be the

1001
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,360
Mona Obedoza Chocolate Chip cookies

1002
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:57,660
wow

1003
00:33:58,526 --> 00:33:59,193
all right

1004
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,950
I truly believe that women should 

1005
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,340
name things more often after themselves

1006
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,780
absolutelyyou know 

1007
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,790
exactly so there we go but I'm just saying

1008
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,020
more women should do it absolutely

1009
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,000
so Georgi I know Georgi should also

1010
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,556
use like for for example on tweet on

1011
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:20,290
 Twitter I think Georgi is really famous

1012
00:34:20,366 --> 00:34:23,923
for espresso with orange juice and that'soh wow

1013
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,710
yes if you go on her twitter you will see 

1014
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,790
that she's having she's posting different

1015
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,110
pictures of that almost dailyI just posted one today 

1016
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,860
exactly so I

1017
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,603
I tried to imagine what espresso 

1018
00:34:34,613 --> 00:34:36,540
with orange juice tastes like

1019
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,429
there you go there you go 

1020
00:34:39,439 --> 00:34:42,439
well it's actually really easy, very easy so

1021
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,669
you need fresh orange juice so you have a

1022
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,869
glass of fresh orange juice and then you

1023
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:51,119
just order a double espresso and you just

1024
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:54,349
pour on top over it slowly and then you'll

1025
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,710
get this double layer like the top layer of

1026
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,480
the espresso and the bottom layer orange juice

1027
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,030
so when you use a straw to drink you

1028
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,710
actually pops down it has a combo of

1029
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,390
espresso and orange juice it's the best for

1030
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,190
the morning because you don't want to be

1031
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,950
awake and you want to be alive so that's

1032
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,980
that's my secret and I'm

1033
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,413
and I heard that in orderyes but I'm not allowed to drink

1034
00:35:18,546 --> 00:35:20,260
you're not allowed to drink coffee yet?

1035
00:35:20,573 --> 00:35:22,110
yes i'm not allowed to drink coffee yet unfortunately

1036
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,910
 if i were i would try this instantly

1037
00:35:24,546 --> 00:35:27,040
but you can have decaf

1038
00:35:27,573 --> 00:35:27,973
espresso

1039
00:35:27,973 --> 00:35:30,563
oh yes okay I will try decaf espresso

1040
00:35:30,573 --> 00:35:32,403
 orange juice so it's the next thing on my 

1041
00:35:32,413 --> 00:35:33,580
on my drink agenda

1042
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,990
and I think that the secret to having this

1043
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,990
layered effect because it's not really

1044
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,390
putting slowly might still not cut it

1045
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,110
because it's also temperature wise they

1046
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,600
have to be

1047
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,940
is to pour with a spoon like you have a

1048
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,110
teaspoon and then you pour it in the spoon

1049
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,520
and that breaks down the gravity and stuff so

1050
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,940
there goes

1051
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,400
I usually prefer those

1052
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,070
orange juice that has like fresh freshly

1053
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,140
squeezed so you have the sap

1054
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,950
so with the sap that's weight so when you

1055
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,640
pour over it will just lays down 

1056
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,246
easy yeah  there you go

1057
00:36:09,246 --> 00:36:10,413
there you go

1058
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,350
so Mona what are some of your goals in the

1059
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,150
future it feels like you have a lot of

1060
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,590
intention in your life compared to at least

1061
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,460
if I remember when I was your age

1062
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,030
I don't remember what I wanted back then

1063
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,680
but it feels like you really know what you want so

1064
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,616
where are you going next what are you gonna do

1065
00:36:28,626 --> 00:36:30,230
well right now I'm in 10th grade in a

1066
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,640
couple of years I hope to go

1067
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,350
to university abroad I'm aiming for like to

1068
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,260
get into like Stanford or MIT or that kind

1069
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,710
a school abroad and learn more about

1070
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,710
programming and technology so that I can go

1071
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,270
back here and then teach more kids how to code

1072
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,360
and all the things and share all things that I've learned I guess

1073
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,980
and I guess

1074
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,246
another another goal of mine is to pilot Mochii Ball

1075
00:36:51,246 --> 00:36:53,183
in more schools so I'm currently

1076
00:36:53,393 --> 00:36:54,950
 I'm currently working with a tech company to

1077
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,543
 pilot it with some schools locally but

1078
00:36:56,543 --> 00:36:58,140
 we're just getting started and I hope

1079
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,380
and I also have to mention it here and

1080
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,470
if anyone wants to try it out in 

1081
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,723
your own school or community you can also

1082
00:37:03,733 --> 00:37:05,950
 reach out to me because we're really trying to 

1083
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,110
spread Mochii Ball and pilot it this

1084
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,990
year so that's another more immediate goal

1085
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,110
of mine to get this Mochii Ball to get

1086
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,790
programming technology integrated in the

1087
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,750
basic education curriculum by making it

1088
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,780
more accessible to kids and also more fun

1089
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,190
hmm right so our podcast is listened to by

1090
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,920
a huge Python community

1091
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,320
so if you other than this

1092
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,420
project

1093
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,030
that you mentioned if you have any other

1094
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,030
help that you need I'm pretty sure they

1095
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,260
will help out just tell us, tell us

1096
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,060
what you needwow thank you so much

1097
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,230
thank you and I guess there is just one

1098
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,470
more thing aside from Mochii Ball and TEDDY 

1099
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,430
as I mentioned I partnered with Accenture to

1100
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,190
hold the Breaking Barriers Building 

1101
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,990
Bridges Hackathon for girls and teach more 

1102
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,870

1108
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,990
