00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:20,066
Hi

2
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,566
Hi everybody and welcome to our PyPodcats

3
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,200
series of Hidden Figures of Python

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,200
and today we have as a guest Sheena O'Connell

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,366
all the way from South Africa

6
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,866
PyPodcats in case anybody forgot

7
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,266
we are a community driven podcast

8
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:39,533
and our aim is to highlight voices

9
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:41,433
from underrepresented groups

10
00:00:41,433 --> 00:00:43,000
in the Python community

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,633
we also have a code of conduct which is um

12
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:49,500
on our website at pypodcats.live/conduct

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,700
when we're working with members of the community

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,800
we follow the PSF Code of conduct

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,400
and to help our interactions

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,200
and keep Python a positive

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,966
successful and growing community

18
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:00,000
so please

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,200
be mindful about that

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,666
when you interact with our material online

21
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:07,133
so today's hosts are Cheuk and me

22
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,066
so I'm uh Tereza

23
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:13,366
I live in Hamburg and I'm part of the PyLadies Hamburg

24
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:17,000
and I'm also data and the career coach

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,533
and data freelancer

26
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:20,566
hi I'm Cheuk and um

27
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:22,200
I am I love Python

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,266
ha ha ha ha

29
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:24,600
OK that's it

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,300
so uh

31
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,900
we have our guest Sheena here

32
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,633
so Sheena do you want to introduce yourself

33
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,966
I've been coding for a long time in Python

34
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,066
it is my love language um

35
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:36,466
and I got to spend about 5 years working in tech

36
00:01:36,466 --> 00:01:37,866
education uh

37
00:01:37,866 --> 00:01:39,800
in the non profit space in South Africa

38
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,700
and it was great and I learned a lot there

39
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:46,966
so now what I'm doing is I teach for a living and I try

40
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:49,733
try to get other educators um

41
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:51,066
connected and leveling up in

42
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:52,400
nice ways um

43
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,300
so I've got a company that does

44
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,766
advanced Django training and soft skills training

45
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:59,166
because that stuff is actually pretty hard um

46
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,000
and I have

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,833
I run a community called the Guild of Educators where

48
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:07,066
um anybody who teaches code

49
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:10,400
or wants to teach code can come and join and hang out

50
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:12,800
um we're starting a teacher's mentorship program

51
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,566
so if you wanna help a teacher level up

52
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:16,766
then you can join that or um

53
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:18,666
if you're a teacher who wants to get better at code

54
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,466
come and join that um

55
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,066
and then the last thing that I'm

56
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:24,500
involved with at the moment is PyCon Africa

57
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,300
so I'm currently the local chair of

58
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,266
of PyCon Africa

59
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:31,033
it's happening in my hometown in Johannesburg

60
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,566
South Africa and actually I

61
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:35,133
I do have a lot of question about Johannesburg

62
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:38,300
and PyCon Africa shall we start with PyCon Africa

63
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,300
and then we can also talk more about your work

64
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,000
sounds good

65
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,266
yeah so for PyCon Africa I

66
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,766
I wonder like

67
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:50,766
so for for folks who never heard of it

68
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:54,533
like is it always going to be in

69
00:02:54,533 --> 00:02:54,900
you know

70
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,466
South Africa or is it going to be travelling around

71
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:01,600
and do you have an other organisation behind it

72
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,366
and how does it work good questions

73
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:05,366
it does travel around

74
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:06,800
so it's not always in the same country

75
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,366
um

76
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:10,000
this is the first time we're doing it in South Africa

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,533
it's the first time we're doing a major

78
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:13,700
like International Python conference in

79
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,500
southern Africa

80
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,933
so it's quite a I think it's gonna be quite impactful

81
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:19,566
but yes it travels around um

82
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,566
I'm not actually sure where we'll do it next year

83
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:22,766
PyCon Africa

84
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:25,366
is basically run by two separate organizations

85
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:27,366
there's the international committee um

86
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:29,100
and those are the folks who just like

87
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,266
stay with the conference wherever it goes

88
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:32,933
and then there's the local committee

89
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:36,600
so the people on the ground who know what's

90
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,333
what to organise the venue and

91
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:41,466
and all of that so our local committee um

92
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:44,166
generally organizes PyCon South Africa every year

93
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,566
and like it's quite an experienced team um

94
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:51,400
it's quite a small team but do good stuff um yeah

95
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,566
so that's how it works

96
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,333
so we're basically joining forces yeah

97
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,700
what do you expect to be different from like

98
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,033
let's say last year PyCon South Africa

99
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,766
alright so it's gonna be a bigger conference um

100
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:03,133
we are reaching further

101
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,066
we're getting a lot more international attention

102
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:07,133
and we've got some um

103
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:09,933
interesting people who are attending so for example

104
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:13,733
Dawn Wages is one of our key notes and she's the uh

105
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:16,400
president of the PSF and that's wonderful

106
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,166
and it's gonna be great to bring her here

107
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,366
so I I don't think we would be able to get as

108
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:22,900
like high profile people in a

109
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:25,000
for PyCon South Africa generally um

110
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,066
so that's one of the things

111
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,100
but the other thing is that

112
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,100
we're putting a lot more effort into giving

113
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,333
financial assistance to folks who otherwise would

114
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,600
not be able to come so

115
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,100
we're working

116
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,600
hard to try and bring people in from the surrounding

117
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,966
southern African countries

118
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,700
and folks from across Africa as well

119
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,700
but we really wanna like because this is the first um

120
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:41,933
big

121
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:44,666
international conference in southern Africa for Python

122
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,066
we wanna just make good use of that so yeah

123
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:50,800
a lot of effort is being put into financial assistance

124
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,033
and that's expensive

125
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:55,066
so we're doing a lot more around fundraising

126
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,133
we've got a donations drive as well

127
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:58,800
that's gonna help with that yeah

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,266
those are the main differences

129
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,966
what are the challenges of organizing a conference

130
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:05,066
in Africa because you have world travel right

131
00:05:05,066 --> 00:05:06,533
you have seen PyConUS 

132
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:08,466
EuroPython all these different conferences

133
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:10,700
so what are the challenges to organize

134
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,900
a conference in Africa compared to

135
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,000
let's say you know PyConUS or a European conference

136
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,600
so I think

137
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,400
I've never organized a conference anywhere else

138
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,100
so I can't give a direct comparison

139
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,300
but I can say that

140
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,066
there are probably challenges that are

141
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,266
standard across the board

142
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:29,800
I mean PyCon Africa is in a way a a newish conference

143
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,133
it's been going on for a little while

144
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:33,200
but it's had some gaps and and things like that

145
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,200
so like

146
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,333
a more established conference

147
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,666
has better systems in place

148
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:37,500
and has um

149
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,000
better documentation in place and things like that

150
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,766
and so

151
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:43,866
there's a lot of just figuring things out and swarming

152
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:47,200
and whenever you want to get

153
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,066
it's a large group of people who are involved

154
00:05:49,066 --> 00:05:49,466
like there's

155
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:51,766
there's a lot of people on the international committee

156
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:54,766
and if you've got a large group of volunteers

157
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:57,733
then it's kind of hard to figure out

158
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,133
like wrangling volunteers is hard in general

159
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:03,200
um especially if you want to do things to a deadline

160
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,800
and to a high standard

161
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:06,600
and not end up doing everything yourself

162
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,333
and things like that

163
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,533
so there's a lot of just like management challenges

164
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:11,300
like figuring out who

165
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:14,433
who are the productive people and what's

166
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,566
what skills does everybody bring to the table

167
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:17,300
and things like that

168
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,800
like that's been that's been tricky

169
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,000
and I think in Africa, Africa specifically there

170
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,266
there are challenges around like

171
00:06:23,266 --> 00:06:25,166
network connectivity and things like that

172
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,700
that comes up and it's also somewhat challenging

173
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,666
because we do have people who are organizing

174
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,000
who are in different time zones

175
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,900
and so we need to wrangle schedules quite a lot

176
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,700
and some people have jobs

177
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,700
some people don't have jobs

178
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,666
some people are students

179
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:40,366
and so that's all that's all challenging to wrangle

180
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,000
and there's also a lot of cultural differences

181
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
so our International Committee

182
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:45,966
it's spread across multiple countries

183
00:06:46,066 --> 00:06:48,200
and a lot of the time when people think of Africa

184
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,266
they think of it as like

185
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:51,500
just like a blob and everything's the same

186
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,700
and it's really not like

187
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,200
there are very big cultural differences

188
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,933
between different African countries

189
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:56,666
and

190
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,133
those cultural differences come with different norms

191
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:00,833
and therefore different expectations

192
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:01,666
and um

193
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,033
different misunderstandings

194
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:04,333
so it's

195
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,933
important to just take a lot of care in communicating

196
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:08,833
like chaos is the default state

197
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:11,600
and so you have to work hard to

198
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,100
make sure that things are well organized

199
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:16,266
I think those are the main things

200
00:07:16,266 --> 00:07:18,666
I wanted to ask a little bit about

201
00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:21,766
you've been in different communities and also in Europe

202
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:24,366
and as Cheuk said also in the States

203
00:07:24,366 --> 00:07:25,900
you saw PyConUS

204
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,866
how is the community different in Africa

205
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:30,900
or South Africa so can you speak for both or

206
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,566
yeah so I've

207
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:35,700
I've only been to PyCon South Africa and PyCon Namibia

208
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,200
in Africa and even these two communities are very

209
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,866
very different so in South Africa

210
00:07:41,866 --> 00:07:44,566
Python is already a very well established language

211
00:07:44,633 --> 00:07:47,566
so most of the big corporates are using it in some way

212
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:50,100
um most of our attendees are professional people

213
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,800
they're they're pretty sorted

214
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,900
um and we do get a lot of young folks as well

215
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,700
who are keen to get into Python in different ways so

216
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,033
so that's great but it's

217
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,200
the fact that it's established

218
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,866
and there's a lot of knowledge in the country already

219
00:08:01,866 --> 00:08:03,700
um a lot of skill there it

220
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,066
it makes things easier

221
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:06,533
if you go to somewhere like Namibia

222
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:08,766
where it's not an industry standard

223
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:09,966
then things get more difficult

224
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:12,733
it's like it's a fledgling community in a way

225
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:16,500
like the community is is strong and connected and they

226
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,366
they do stuff and they run their conference and

227
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:20,866
and it's all wonderful

228
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,700
that's like

229
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,800
people need somebody to learn from a lot of the time

230
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,933
and so with something like pack on Namibia

231
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:28,066
one of the things it's

232
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,466
one of the goals there is to bring skills in

233
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:33,100
so that we can share skills with

234
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,666
the Namibian community yeah

235
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,566
so so it varies from place to place

236
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:38,133
and I'm sure that a lot of African countries

237
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:39,366
are more similar to Namibia

238
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:40,966
than to South Africa and we've

239
00:08:40,966 --> 00:08:43,733
we've got it like it's it's pretty good here

240
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:46,600
when did you get started with Python and how?

241
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,266
so I got started um

242
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:52,100
when I was in university I was coding for food

243
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,200
I I started I learned to code um

244
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,933
like as a teenager and I really liked it

245
00:08:56,933 --> 00:09:00,466
so when I was studying I needed money and um

246
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:02,266
so I was just taking on these odd jobs

247
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:03,733
and at one point

248
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:07,466
somebody offered me a Django development gig um

249
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:08,366
they wanted to build this

250
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:11,366
like soccer membership website thing

251
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:13,933
and they were like can you write a Django website

252
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:15,166
and I said yes

253
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,566
and then I figured out how to

254
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:19,933
and through learning Django

255
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:20,266
like there

256
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:22,500
there was this book called The Django Book um

257
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,566
but now it's very out of date

258
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:25,266
and it's not a thing anymore

259
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,166
but that was my introduction to Python yeah

260
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:30,266
so I learned that and I learned Python

261
00:09:30,266 --> 00:09:32,400
sort of as a side effect of trying to do this

262
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,533
and it was great it just fitted my

263
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,500
brain really well since then

264
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:37,133
like Python

265
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:39,666
wasn't taught in university or anything like that when

266
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,300
when I was there after university

267
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,066
I gravitated towards software development jobs

268
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:46,333
and I just I did a bunch of different things

269
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,300
but I always missed Python

270
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,366
and then as soon as I could work with Python again

271
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:51,033
I jumped on it yeah

272
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:52,000
I mean

273
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,266
I can ask more stuff but you read a programming book

274
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,266
do you still read programming books

275
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,133
bits and pieces sometimes um

276
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,500
but it's very rare for me to read a whole programming

277
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,100
book I read a book on PHP once for a job

278
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,900
but like I haven't learned a lot of languages

279
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,366
since I learned Python um

280
00:10:09,366 --> 00:10:09,933
I've 

281
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:11,133
I've done a bunch of different things

282
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:13,133
I've learned PHP and I think C#

283
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:15,466
I find that I learn best

284
00:10:15,466 --> 00:10:17,466
often by getting my hands dirty

285
00:10:17,466 --> 00:10:20,400
so I'll dig into documentation

286
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,200
and something that I find as well is that like

287
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,366
a lot of the concepts

288
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:26,500
from one language are transferable to another

289
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,000
so if like a functions a functions a function um

290
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,300
so

291
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,000
a lot of the time when learning a different language

292
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,100
it's like you wanna

293
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,000
figure out how the concepts you already know

294
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,366
map to this other thing

295
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:37,966
and then you wanna find out what

296
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:39,800
kind of the idioms are of

297
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,100
of the new language

298
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,266
so often my way of learning is very um

299
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:45,333
I wouldn't say it's chaotic

300
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,366
it's it's directed towards a goal

301
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,300
I'll want to do a specific thing

302
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,133
and then I'll go and find out how to do like

303
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:53,066
all the little pieces

304
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:55,166
that I need to know in order to achieve that thing

305
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,166
yeah I think I

306
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,066
I did read the Kubernetes book

307
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,500
um yeah

308
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,966
what else I don't know

309
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:04,733
I actually wonder how many people are like

310
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:07,100
learn things like that cause I am the same

311
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,266
like I, I can only learn if I am doing it

312
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:11,800
cause otherwise I would just be

313
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,100
you know this side in

314
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,000
that side out right

315
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,766
like ha ha ha cause like

316
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:16,266
oh yeah it's

317
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:17,333
it's a it's a good read

318
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,400
but then like uh

319
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,466
what is it about hmm

320
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:21,033
can't remember ha ha

321
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,866
so yeah I think for me

322
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:25,800
project driven learning is very helpful

323
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,466
so it's like you learn you wanna learn a thing

324
00:11:27,466 --> 00:11:28,066
like

325
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:31,266
let's say when I learnt react or something like that

326
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,133
like I've learnt a bunch of different tools

327
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:36,100
um and these tools have different tutorials

328
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,100
that you can follow and you can follow the tutorial

329
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,600
and you can stay on that golden path

330
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,066
and learn what they want you to learn

331
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:43,333
and you get the major concepts

332
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,666
and you get the major building blocks

333
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:45,533
and you're like okay cool

334
00:11:45,533 --> 00:11:47,366
how do I get it to do this other thing

335
00:11:47,366 --> 00:11:50,166
and then you research that and you end up learning more

336
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:53,466
um and you find out where you need to go deeper

337
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,133
so that's useful for me

338
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,900
but I,  I do think that books are helpful

339
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,400
in a lot of places as well

340
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,700
because it does give you a

341
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,500
a narrative flow

342
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,866
and it helps you to kind of stay on task

343
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:06,800
for folks who are newer to programming language

344
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,133
I would usually say like

345
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:11,200
find a structured resource to learn from

346
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,000
because there's just so much stuff out there

347
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,200
the signal to noise ratio is really bad

348
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:19,966
so if you just find like one good trusted source

349
00:12:19,966 --> 00:12:22,566
and you use that as a starting point

350
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:24,166
then that's probably good yeah

351
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:27,466
is this why you got into teaching as well as

352
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:28,500
because you

353
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,033
you felt like the material out there is more noise than

354
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,866
hmm not really

355
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:35,133
so so even in the noise

356
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:36,566
there's a lot of good stuff

357
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,866
uh it's just that there's like

358
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:38,500
people pull

359
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,666
each other in all sorts of different directions

360
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:41,166
for me

361
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,166
teaching was something that I always wanted to do

362
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,066
in some way like I um

363
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:48,066
I've always been teaching like when I was a little kid

364
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:51,000
I used to teach grownups Excel skills

365
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,533
and I taught the other kids maths and tutored them

366
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:56,100
and I've taught people different sports

367
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,800
and it's always been a thing in my life

368
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,733
but it's not something that I like pursued as a career

369
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:02,900
but it's always been something that I've cared about

370
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,500
like it's always clicked with me really well

371
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,166
so I was a really awkward kid and helping people with

372
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,600
their homework was a good source of connection

373
00:13:09,766 --> 00:13:12,366
so I think a lot of it comes from that yeah

374
00:13:12,366 --> 00:13:15,466
then wait you did that for free um

375
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,366
some people paid me but I also just

376
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:19,866
you did that for free and when I was in school

377
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,666
like people and stuff sometimes yes

378
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:26,500
sometimes no and it depended on the situation yeah OK

379
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,200
I did it I got paid

380
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:31,066
so people that people become your friend

381
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:32,866
so they can borrow your homework

382
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:34,633
like the the morning

383
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
no no

384
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,533
no borrowing was for free

385
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:42,966
but I liked helping people to understand stuff um

386
00:13:42,966 --> 00:13:44,133
that was always a thing so I

387
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:44,533
I didn't

388
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,366
like all my homework in exchange for friendship

389
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,200
like that would be that would be a bit sad

390
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,366
um but it was

391
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:53,966
it was a way to connect it's like cool

392
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,700
you you wanna get better at this thing

393
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,333
let's no doubt about it like

394
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,733
if you're teaching person a thing

395
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:00,900
and you really want them to understand something

396
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:03,400
then you have to understand them um

397
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,166
so you do build some connections there

398
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:07,266
and I found that a lot with my students as well

399
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:10,233
more recently it's like you really do

400
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,700
like you get into each other's heads a little bit

401
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,166
but back to your question about like

402
00:14:14,166 --> 00:14:15,766
how I got into teaching

403
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:17,533
I've been working for a bunch of startups

404
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:20,300
and I was feeling thoroughly burnt out and used up

405
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,000
and I was thinking about what I really

406
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,466
wanted to do I was like I've been

407
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:26,500
I've been working so hard

408
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,133
chasing other people's dreams

409
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,300
and what do I want to do it's like

410
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,066
I want to make an impact on people's lives

411
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:36,166
and education is a really amazing way to do that

412
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,766
I mean if you think about it

413
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:39,066
you you just have like

414
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:40,966
a bunch of conversations with a person

415
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:43,566
and then their trajectory changes in a massive way

416
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:45,800
and sometimes it's not even that hard to

417
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,400
to move a people a person quite significantly

418
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:51,166
so I got to a point I was like cool

419
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,866
I wanna work in education

420
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:55,200
I want to start a code school for for women

421
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,966
I want to do this this is gonna be great

422
00:14:56,966 --> 00:14:59,000
and then I was thinking about like okay

423
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,566
what does it take to start a code school

424
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,600
I'm going to need um

425
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:08,200
desks and a venue and HR and payroll and and

426
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,533
and all of these like

427
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,000
things that I'm not that interested in

428
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,166
and if you think about like the business of education

429
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:14,800
there's there's like

430
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,800
so much stuff that you need to do that isn't teaching

431
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,300
and so I was bashing my head on this for a while

432
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,833
but at the time I was like

433
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,800
I'm taking on like random little freelance gigs

434
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,866
and I'm just trying to get more exposure

435
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:29,700
so I went to a PyCon

436
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,066
a PyCon South Africa event and I ran a workshop there

437
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,600
and I I like I literally just

438
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,066
did it so that um

439
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:38,933
more people could see what I was about

440
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:40,400
I wanted more exposure

441
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,733
and I wanted to teach people a thing

442
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:42,900
and I wanted to learn a thing

443
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,966
so so I did that

444
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,166
now with PyCon South Africa

445
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,666
you can charge for your workshops

446
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,666
that's just how it usually goes

447
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,700
um but I decided not to charge for mine because I

448
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,966
I was just like bring more people

449
00:15:53,966 --> 00:15:55,666
and so because my workshop was the cheapest

450
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,166
it was very full of students

451
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,100
um and hahaha

452
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:02,500
some of those students were from this non profit

453
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:06,266
coding bootcamp and they kind of swarmed me afterwards

454
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,366
and they were like this is great

455
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:10,366
don't you wanna come and run a workshop at our place

456
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:12,200
I was like okay cool

457
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,100
I'll I'll try that out for free

458
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,300
or you can charge them this time

459
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,000
no I was just like cool

460
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,066
I'll just do it for free

461
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,166
because like these people obviously don't have a lot

462
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,933
and they're obviously like really

463
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:24,666
really hungry to learn I'm

464
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,300
I'm a sucker for for teaching

465
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,800
so I went there and I did that

466
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,800
and I ran a couple of workshops and I got to know the

467
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,000
the people who were running the place

468
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,600
and I got to see what their education system was like

469
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,766
and it wasn't good enough

470
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,266
and so I ended up working there um

471
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:45,100
and eventually being their CTO

472
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,666
so I started off working part-time

473
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,800
and then ramped up and ramped

474
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,566
up and ramped up

475
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:50,500
and then I was just like part of the woodwork

476
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,566
so when I started working there was very um

477
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:56,333
it was very scrappy and I like scrappy but the

478
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,600
the syllabus itself that they were teaching wasn't it

479
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,133
it had big gaps in it it was like they'd have a

480
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:02,366
a couple of paragraphs to

481
00:17:02,366 --> 00:17:03,666
to read about unit testing

482
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,266
it was like cool now you know unit testing

483
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:06,066
so

484
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,266
what I did was I built out some new programs for them

485
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:12,133
and I just kind of solidified the stuff that they had

486
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:13,766
and made it really really solid

487
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,533
and through doing that I learnt a lot about

488
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:18,700
about teaching and about brains and about like

489
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,300
how to teach the basics of Python and other languages

490
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,366
there was Javascript there as well and that was cool

491
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:26,166
and then CoVid happened haha

492
00:17:26,366 --> 00:17:27,500
so um

493
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,033
we we were originally an on premises training provider

494
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,400
um

495
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,833
and we had about 250 students working in this converted

496
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:38,000
underground parking lot basically

497
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,400
we had this apartment building

498
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,600
and then there was a parking lot and like a

499
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,666
another parking lot with natural light

500
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,700
and we converted that into studios

501
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,600
um and so we had like all these students in there

502
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,666
and we helped them out with cheap accommodation

503
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,866
around the building as well

504
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:53,200
and then when Covid happened

505
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,533
we had to send everybody home

506
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:56,466
but we had to keep supporting them as well

507
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:59,333
so ended up building a whole lot of um

508
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,500
tooling to help with remote teaching

509
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,866
and it worked super super well

510
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:04,066
and again like

511
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:05,900
Learned a ton about just like

512
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,966
how to keep people motivated and connected remotely

513
00:18:08,966 --> 00:18:09,700
yeah that's

514
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,600
that changed my life and trajectory

515
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,533
I think I can totally relate to that

516
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:16,100
I think I was also working at a boot camp school

517
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,366
right before Covid and then during Covid

518
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:19,700
and I also had like

519
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,600
a lot of lessons Learned already from my previous job

520
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,400
when we had a team in Berlin and a team in Hamburg

521
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,666
and we were trying to kind of work hybrid

522
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:31,366
which was always a mess and so I

523
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,666
I was like yeah

524
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,533
that thing where five people are in the room

525
00:18:34,533 --> 00:18:35,933
and five people are at home

526
00:18:35,933 --> 00:18:37,500
is not working out very well either

527
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,800
everybody's at home

528
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:40,766
yeah yeah

529
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:42,600
we didn't do hybrid do you think like

530
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,733
cause you said that like

531
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:46,800
the biggest change is that you give this workshop in uh

532
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,400
PyCon South Africa so do you think yeah

533
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:52,166
the community kind of changed your life in some way

534
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:53,700
oh yeah

535
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,800
yeah many times over

536
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,966
so there was that one that was very impactful

537
00:18:56,966 --> 00:18:59,366
a couple of years later just like on a whim

538
00:18:59,366 --> 00:19:01,100
I was like let's see if there are any

539
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,266
international conferences that I can maybe get to

540
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:06,733
and my first international conference was a Django con

541
00:19:06,733 --> 00:19:07,200
US

542
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,666
I applied and I asked for a grant and I was just like

543
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:10,800
probably nothing will come of

544
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,666
this that I got to go and that's where I met um

545
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:17,100
a bunch of the Django Con Africa folks

546
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,533
and that was also impactful

547
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,066
and I met a lot of other people there that I

548
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:23,166
connected with quite well

549
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,666
and I'm like friends with

550
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,300
and they've supported me in a bunch of

551
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,466
the things that I've been doing

552
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,600
and I support and I support them where I can as well

553
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,900
meeting the Django Con Africa people was lovely

554
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,700
I I helped organise the first Django Con Africa

555
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,866
that was in Tanzania in Zanzibar

556
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:42,833
which is epic and um yeah

557
00:19:42,866 --> 00:19:45,400
met some amazing people there again and it

558
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,200
it sort of snowballed from there

559
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,000
so now I speak at a lot of international conferences um

560
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,600
I've been asked to keynote

561
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,200
in all sorts of fancy places

562
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,733
which has been epic as well

563
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:57,933
and I've learnt a lot like

564
00:19:57,933 --> 00:19:59,566
I've learnt about different

565
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:02,500
tools and technologies that have changed my opinion of

566
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:02,933
like

567
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:05,333
what is worth focusing on and what is worth teaching

568
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,033
and what I recommend to organizations

569
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,300
so that's been really good and impactful

570
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,666
and some of the connections

571
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,266
that I've made there as well have been good

572
00:20:14,266 --> 00:20:18,000
so like networking like business networking

573
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,900
can sometimes feel

574
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,600
a little bit slimy in different ways but um

575
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:24,933
it's been a really good networking opportunity

576
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,066
so I go to these different conferences

577
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:29,166
and I try to talk to as many people as I can

578
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:30,966
and I try to add value and

579
00:20:30,966 --> 00:20:33,100
I try to connect people with other people

580
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,666
and join different dots

581
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,400
and it's an experience every time

582
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,866
it's very stimulating and I learn a bunch every time

583
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:41,500
but some pretty good opportunities

584
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,600
have come out of it as well

585
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,933
so I would say that yeah

586
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:47,300
Python conferences have changed my life

587
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,600
it's been very very good

588
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,766
oh it's good to hear that cause um

589
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:53,033
I feel the same so yeah

590
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:57,400
that's great how did they change your life

591
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:58,666
well I mean

592
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,366
this is your podcast so

593
00:21:00,366 --> 00:21:02,566
I would wait until I got to be

594
00:21:02,566 --> 00:21:04,200
a guest in another podcast

595
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:06,100
OK I'll

596
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,966
I'll invite you to something haha

597
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:08,733
yeah

598
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:11,766
I think nobody knows Cheuk when they go to a conference

599
00:21:11,766 --> 00:21:13,100
and everybody's like oh

600
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,666
who's Cheuk no yeah nobody yeah

601
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,900
so I like to always also ask something about

602
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,900
what do you do besides Python and teaching

603
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,866
and do you mean like uh

604
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,366
hobbies and fun stuff or I don't know

605
00:21:28,366 --> 00:21:31,733
is it hobbies or is that another passion that you have

606
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:34,133
depends on the level of involvement

607
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:35,333
I guess yeah

608
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,000
so I do have different passions

609
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,300
um Python is a thing that takes up a lot of my time

610
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,333
teaching in general takes up a lot of my time

611
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,300
the non python stuff is soft skills

612
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,466
so I do train people in in different soft skills

613
00:21:46,466 --> 00:21:50,033
so one of the products that I have at the moment is

614
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,600
it's for helping teams become better teams

615
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:53,866
um so basically what

616
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:56,200
I do is I go and um

617
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,300
like if there's a team that's

618
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,200
that's struggling to team in some way

619
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,666
then I will gather a bunch of information

620
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,733
and do a bunch of surveys

621
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:06,000
and talk to people in the team and their leadership

622
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,933
and figure out like

623
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:08,733
what's actually going wrong or

624
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:10,000
and what's going right as well

625
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,200
because often a lot of things are going right

626
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:14,366
they can be amplified um

627
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,566
often there's like weird

628
00:22:15,566 --> 00:22:17,333
structural issues that have

629
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,933
strange pitfalls and side effects

630
00:22:18,933 --> 00:22:20,533
that people aren't fully aware of

631
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:20,900
sometimes

632
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,700
there's some cultural differences within the team

633
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,766
there's like all sorts of weird

634
00:22:23,766 --> 00:22:25,000
complicated things that happen

635
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,266
and then based on that I come up with

636
00:22:27,266 --> 00:22:28,200
like a course

637
00:22:28,266 --> 00:22:29,466
specifically for that team

638
00:22:29,466 --> 00:22:30,133
that covers

639
00:22:30,133 --> 00:22:32,000
different skills that they are likely to need

640
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:34,533
but it's not really like

641
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:37,466
you can't just tell a person how to be a good teammate

642
00:22:37,466 --> 00:22:38,966
and then they go and be a good teammate

643
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:39,900
it doesn't work like that

644
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,366
because a lot of things are down to

645
00:22:42,466 --> 00:22:44,200
habits and small changes

646
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,000
and that's not something you can just do once off

647
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,066
so these courses typically take a while

648
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:53,200
so I'm running a 12 week week course at the moment

649
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:55,900
and I'm not seeing everybody every week or every day

650
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,166
like I'm seeing them once every two weeks basically

651
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:01,400
like on average but then between that time

652
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,900
they are given different challenges and exercises

653
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,533
that help them to team better

654
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:07,533
and yeah it's

655
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:09,333
it's been really really good

656
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:11,166
so as of my other

657
00:23:11,366 --> 00:23:13,900
a strong interest is organizational psychology

658
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,466
and just like how to be a good teammate

659
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,300
and do people follow through

660
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:21,266
so it's it's tricky

661
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,533
um a lot of people do

662
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:23,500
some people don't

663
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,866
whenever you run like training for a corporate

664
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,966
where your uh

665
00:23:28,966 --> 00:23:29,500
where the training

666
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,900
participants have been told to be there

667
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:34,466
then like there will be resistance

668
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,300
especially if they've been told to be there

669
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:36,933
because it's like

670
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:38,466
you're going to be a better teammate now

671
00:23:38,466 --> 00:23:40,700
ha ha like you need some soft skills

672
00:23:40,733 --> 00:23:43,300
like people don't always receive that very well um

673
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,566
and so yeah

674
00:23:44,566 --> 00:23:46,300
there's a couple of different ways to get buy in

675
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,600
and buying is so so important

676
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,733
like one of the biggest challenges

677
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:52,966
of adult education is motivation

678
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:54,066
and focus cause

679
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:55,666
there's so many different things that take our

680
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,166
attention and want our attention

681
00:23:57,166 --> 00:24:00,433
and many of these things are very important and um

682
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:02,833
sometimes you just don't want to learn the thing

683
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,666
so

684
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:07,800
what I do is I try to make the training hyper relevant

685
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,300
so I find out from the individuals in the team

686
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,200
what they want what problems they see

687
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,400
what good they want to grow

688
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,866
and then I frame things in a way that shows them like

689
00:24:17,866 --> 00:24:19,566
cool these things that you want

690
00:24:19,566 --> 00:24:21,100
we're actually gonna cover that

691
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,733
and this thing that I was gonna cover

692
00:24:22,733 --> 00:24:24,966
I can tweak it so it covers this other thing that that

693
00:24:24,966 --> 00:24:25,900
you're interested in

694
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,633
and so that's part of it is just like

695
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,966
like actually being direct about like cool

696
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:32,666
I'm gonna give you what you want to some extent

697
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,000
to some reasonable extent

698
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:36,166
then the other thing is

699
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,333
showing people that by taking part in the training

700
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:40,333
they can actually support each other's growth

701
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:42,266
so sometimes you'll get people who show up who are like

702
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:43,066
yeah I don't need this

703
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:45,166
like I'm a great team player always

704
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:47,566
and I don't need this but those other guys need this

705
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:49,733
so for those people you can say cool

706
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:52,766
like your voice is actually really useful here

707
00:24:52,766 --> 00:24:54,766
because you clearly know some stuff

708
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:57,066
you can help to direct this training

709
00:24:57,066 --> 00:25:00,200
like you your input is going to be useful to the people

710
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,166
around you so that's helpful

711
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:04,033
so so far I haven't

712
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,400
so like with with the course I'm running at the moment

713
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,100
um there's about 30 people and they're very

714
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,366
very multicultural

715
00:25:11,366 --> 00:25:13,366
and it's a very complicated team structure

716
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:15,700
if you're familiar with the team topologies book

717
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:18,600
so I read so I don't read a lot of programming books

718
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,266
but I read a lot of life business books and like

719
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:22,133
structure books

720
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:26,466
but Team Topologies is kind of a book about like

721
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:28,666
design patterns for organizing teams

722
00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:30,633
in complicated organizations

723
00:25:30,933 --> 00:25:33,800
and they've got a bunch of different um configurations

724
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,066
so like sometimes

725
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:37,700
you'll have a team that's focused on a specific project

726
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,466
or a specific like type of work um

727
00:25:40,466 --> 00:25:42,366
and sometimes you'll have a team

728
00:25:42,366 --> 00:25:45,500
that is actually distributed in different ways like um

729
00:25:45,566 --> 00:25:47,566
you get this thing called an enabling team

730
00:25:47,566 --> 00:25:49,033
and an enabling team

731
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,000
like they're kind of like a guild and they

732
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,133
they level up their skills

733
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:54,200
and they level up their tools

734
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,733
but then the individual members will go and

735
00:25:56,733 --> 00:25:59,266
help other teams level up in the same way

736
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:02,366
so it's about enabling different projects so um

737
00:26:02,366 --> 00:26:03,866
the team that I'm working with is something

738
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:04,933
like an enabling team

739
00:26:04,933 --> 00:26:06,500
and something like a platform team

740
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,066
and so

741
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:10,266
it's just like a really weird structure to work in

742
00:26:10,266 --> 00:26:12,166
so it's kind of like a data team right

743
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,100
yeah yeah

744
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,766
kind of like a data team kind of like

745
00:26:14,766 --> 00:26:16,766
like if you imagine a big organization

746
00:26:16,766 --> 00:26:18,300
that has lots of software projects

747
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,666
and then you have a security team just handle security

748
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:23,566
like imagine how they would need to work

749
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:24,266
like they

750
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:26,400
they can't go and fix all the problems themselves

751
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,400
but they can kind of build a

752
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,600
a paved road that other like project like

753
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,133
um product specific teams can

754
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:36,033
can walk along and they can go and share skills

755
00:26:36,266 --> 00:26:37,866
and they can define like uh

756
00:26:37,866 --> 00:26:42,366
maturity levels for different projects and just kind of

757
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:45,066
um put ownership of quality on other people

758
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:48,300
but still keep an eye on things and maintain that level

759
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,533
so so yeah

760
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:50,800
it's been it's been interesting

761
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,866
I just wanted to say that it's kind of the same

762
00:26:52,866 --> 00:26:54,466
it reminds me of uh

763
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,166
when we were at work and we were always saying

764
00:26:57,166 --> 00:26:58,333
we don't need a retrospective

765
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,900
this month or this two week

766
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,100
like this time you know

767
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,500
we have no problems you know

768
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,466
everything is fine

769
00:27:03,466 --> 00:27:06,066
and then you do a retrospective and then it's like ah

770
00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:10,133
one hour was not enough that's like yeah

771
00:27:10,133 --> 00:27:12,333
to talk about all the things that

772
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,500
we have no problem with yeah

773
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,433
yes yeah

774
00:27:17,366 --> 00:27:18,933
often I find that well

775
00:27:18,933 --> 00:27:20,666
there's this exercise that I'm doing with

776
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:22,200
with this team in in particular

777
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,733
like we're we're talking about different concepts

778
00:27:24,733 --> 00:27:25,500
and why they matter

779
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,166
like why psychological safety matters

780
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:28,466
why dependability matters

781
00:27:28,466 --> 00:27:30,666
and how these things are related and things like that

782
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:33,700
but then an exercise that I do with people is um

783
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,800
Kaizen thing um

784
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,633
so Kaizen is a

785
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,800
like a Japanese business philosophy thing about um

786
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,733
making small changes and you can make

787
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:46,933
like tiny improvements to how you work

788
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:48,200
and those tiny improvements

789
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,533
even if they seem insignificant

790
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:51,200
they add up and they can do big things

791
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,000
so then people come up with their own

792
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,333
little improvements that they want to make

793
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:57,333
and they commit to it in a public way

794
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:59,266
and then they go and they do those things

795
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,266
and coupled with that I

796
00:28:01,266 --> 00:28:04,066
I get folks to pay attention to each other

797
00:28:04,066 --> 00:28:06,066
and try to notice the good things that are happening

798
00:28:06,066 --> 00:28:06,800
so that they can say like

799
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,100
hey I saw you do this good thing

800
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,066
well done and that's been

801
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:10,800
really really cool so like

802
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,700
here's an example of a small kaizen

803
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,433
thing that a person can do

804
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,800
so one of the people in the team was like

805
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
every time I go to a stand up in the morning

806
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,933
I feel really anxious and then I

807
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,966
I go into the stand up and I just like

808
00:28:23,966 --> 00:28:26,233
waffle and ramble and

809
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,166
and then I just feel bad it's like okay

810
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,366
how are we going to solve this

811
00:28:29,366 --> 00:28:30,933
um we'll solve it by spending like

812
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:32,533
five to 10 minutes before the stand up

813
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:33,933
just thinking about what I'm gonna say

814
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:35,400
and it's like this really

815
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,900
really small thing that you can do

816
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,400
but then she goes to her stand up and she's prepared

817
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,966
she's not anxious um

818
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:42,700
she's more able to pay attention to the people

819
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,600
around her cause

820
00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:45,300
because she's not caught up in her

821
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,800
internal anxiety loops and the rest of the team

822
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,800
get better clarity on her tasks and what she needs

823
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,733
and so they're more able to help her um

824
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:57,400
they're more able to focus on her stuff

825
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:57,933
and they're

826
00:28:57,933 --> 00:28:59,966
more able to have space to talk about their stuff

827
00:28:59,966 --> 00:29:01,133
so it's like this little

828
00:29:01,133 --> 00:29:03,366
tiny thing with potentially a big impact

829
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,300
and there's loads of things like that

830
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,333
like lots and lots yeah

831
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:08,966
so I have a question for you

832
00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:10,900
so if you have to choose right

833
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,866
you can either work with Python

834
00:29:12,866 --> 00:29:15,466
the programming language or so either

835
00:29:15,466 --> 00:29:18,900
or you can do both or people what

836
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,666
would you choose hi

837
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,133
so actually like so I love Python so much

838
00:29:25,133 --> 00:29:26,700
but I think actually people

839
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,666
and the reason I say that is because in the end

840
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:32,266
like if you wanna build something big

841
00:29:32,266 --> 00:29:34,166
it's a it's a team sport like if you're

842
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:35,966
if you're just working by yourself on something

843
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:37,700
like you can do some pretty epic things

844
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,933
but the

845
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:40,366
most impressive things are generally

846
00:29:40,366 --> 00:29:41,700
done by teams of people

847
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,966
and getting people to team well is like

848
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,333
there's just so much to be unlocked

849
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:47,900
there's so much leverage to be added

850
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,766
people sometimes talk about 10 x developers

851
00:29:50,766 --> 00:29:51,400
and stuff like that

852
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,066
it's very hard to make a 10 x developer

853
00:29:53,066 --> 00:29:54,766
it's very hard to be a 10 x developer

854
00:29:54,766 --> 00:29:56,666
it's very hard to find a 10 x developer

855
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:58,300
but you can take a team and make it

856
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,500
make it like a 10 x team

857
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,700
and it's not actually that bad to do like it's like

858
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,166
it's generally like it like

859
00:30:05,166 --> 00:30:07,266
if you just look at it with the right lens

860
00:30:07,566 --> 00:30:11,733
and get people to be motivated to make small changes

861
00:30:11,733 --> 00:30:13,366
you can do some amazing things

862
00:30:13,366 --> 00:30:17,100
and you don't necessarily need to stop at 10 x either

863
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,200
so that's part of it

864
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,066
and then the other part of it is like

865
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:21,800
LLMs are changing a lot of things

866
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,966
and they are adding a lot of leverage to programmers

867
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,733
and they are also they're changing the landscape in

868
00:30:28,733 --> 00:30:30,066
in a lot of different ways

869
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,700
but people are getting to a point where

870
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,966
we're realizing what the uniquely human skills are

871
00:30:35,966 --> 00:30:38,566
and if we can grow those human skills

872
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,400
then that's great so I think that there yeah

873
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,666
I think that there's a lot of space for just like

874
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:45,900
growing individual people in

875
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,266
in how they interact with one another

876
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:48,133
I think that's a good call

877
00:30:48,133 --> 00:30:49,900
because I think a lot of developers

878
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,266
doesn't put that much emphasis on the people element

879
00:30:53,266 --> 00:30:55,266
that can really help their career

880
00:30:55,266 --> 00:30:56,266
but they just overlook it

881
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:57,300
they just thought like if

882
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,600
if I'm become quote unquote

883
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,800
the best developer I don't know how you quantified it

884
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,933
but like that I would be you know

885
00:31:03,933 --> 00:31:06,200
I would do really well in my career

886
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,566
but I guess there are a lot of

887
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:11,300
people element in it that developers overlook

888
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,733
yeah I think that works up to a point

889
00:31:13,733 --> 00:31:14,933
and then after that point

890
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:18,633
you are like you need to work with other people

891
00:31:18,766 --> 00:31:21,800
um a metaphor I really like is soccer

892
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,766
um or football

893
00:31:22,766 --> 00:31:24,066
depending on where you're from

894
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,666
your

895
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:27,133
individual skills as a soccer player really matter

896
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:30,300
quite a lot but most of the game of soccer

897
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,866
like if you watch people practice

898
00:31:31,966 --> 00:31:33,000
like practice soccer

899
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,300
a lot of emphasis is placed on passing the ball really

900
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,833
really well and that means setting the person up for

901
00:31:39,866 --> 00:31:41,266
the next person up for success

902
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,500
and that means

903
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:45,066
also being aware of what other people are doing

904
00:31:45,066 --> 00:31:46,966
like you need that that context

905
00:31:47,133 --> 00:31:48,133
and so that means paying

906
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:50,166
attention to things outside of your little bubble

907
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:52,766
but it also means just taking

908
00:31:52,766 --> 00:31:55,000
care as you craft different things

909
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,166
so let's think about a pull request as a

910
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,766
as a ball passing moment like

911
00:31:59,766 --> 00:32:01,166
how can you craft a pull request

912
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:03,233
to set the next person up for success

913
00:32:03,366 --> 00:32:05,400
like make it clear and specific

914
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,566
and don't do a million different things at once

915
00:32:08,566 --> 00:32:10,566
don't make it like a mega pull request

916
00:32:10,566 --> 00:32:12,266
that's just gonna confuse people

917
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:13,566
if you make it super huge

918
00:32:13,566 --> 00:32:16,633
then your whoever's reviewing it might um

919
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,466
they're a human they might lose focus

920
00:32:18,466 --> 00:32:21,100
if you make it small so they can fit it in their brain

921
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:22,666
then they will do a better job

922
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:24,166
so like

923
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:25,766
there's all sorts of different ways to just like

924
00:32:25,766 --> 00:32:27,800
make that one interaction better

925
00:32:28,066 --> 00:32:30,466
another way you can pass a ball is like

926
00:32:30,466 --> 00:32:31,800
asking a person for help

927
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,100
you can ask a person for help well or badly

928
00:32:34,866 --> 00:32:36,733
and you can build up like you

929
00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:38,600
you can build these skills

930
00:32:38,733 --> 00:32:40,100
a lot of really good

931
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,166
like technically skilled developers

932
00:32:42,666 --> 00:32:45,666
they'll hear about these teamwork good practices

933
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:46,600
and they'll nod and smile

934
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,400
and then just like make massive weird PRs anyway

935
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,766
because they

936
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:56,100
they don't necessarily value passing the ball well

937
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:58,600
and that's harms the people in their team

938
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,100
or it affects productivity

939
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,533
yeah I think it's not only I

940
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:05,366
I think sometimes um

941
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:07,100
what I noticed was not necessary that they don't

942
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,466
that people don't value passing the ball well

943
00:33:09,466 --> 00:33:11,300
but it's actually it's hard

944
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,133
it's a lot it's a different work

945
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:16,366
it's different work to do that well

946
00:33:16,366 --> 00:33:18,900
compared to just coding you know

947
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,200
a lot and like really making it bite size and what not

948
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,833
so that's kind of like it

949
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,333
I think it's more of a subconsciously

950
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:30,000
it's like learning a new skill and you want

951
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,933
you need to you need to

952
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:33,866
wanna learn to be in a space where you want to learn

953
00:33:33,866 --> 00:33:36,866
so I guess it's like kind of like when you pass a ball

954
00:33:36,866 --> 00:33:37,300
like I

955
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,566
I Learned it when I was like playing in the playground

956
00:33:39,566 --> 00:33:42,166
right like when I was I was a very again

957
00:33:42,166 --> 00:33:43,733
like I'm not really good at sports

958
00:33:43,733 --> 00:33:46,866
I have no like sporty nerve in me

959
00:33:46,866 --> 00:33:48,866
so I'm suck at like you know

960
00:33:48,933 --> 00:33:50,266
even passing the ball right

961
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:52,866
mostly just like hit my head or I just miss it

962
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:54,333
and I have to chase after it right

963
00:33:54,333 --> 00:33:56,600
so I was told how to like

964
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,566
really do the ball pass is to like

965
00:33:58,566 --> 00:33:59,466
when you pass the ball

966
00:33:59,466 --> 00:34:02,100
you have to make sure looking at the other person

967
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,566
make sure they are ready you are ready

968
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:04,133
and then you

969
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:06,866
you have to aim at giving the ball to them

970
00:34:06,866 --> 00:34:08,200
rather than just whatever

971
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,966
float it so I think that's the difference right

972
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,400
like if you're just kind of float

973
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,366
it's like oh

974
00:34:13,366 --> 00:34:14,800
you didn't catch it that's your fault

975
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,566
it's like no

976
00:34:15,566 --> 00:34:17,733
but you didn't tell me that you're going to float at me

977
00:34:17,733 --> 00:34:19,366
and then like of course I didn't get it

978
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:21,566
it hit hit my face and like whatever

979
00:34:21,566 --> 00:34:22,366
right like

980
00:34:22,366 --> 00:34:23,966
so you know that

981
00:34:23,966 --> 00:34:25,133
you know actually

982
00:34:25,133 --> 00:34:27,333
just passing a ball is different from just

983
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,066
randomly throwing a ball at people

984
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:31,800
so it's and also people always think oh

985
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,366
it's your fault that you didn't catch it

986
00:34:33,366 --> 00:34:34,066
it's like but it no

987
00:34:34,066 --> 00:34:35,666
it's your fault that you didn't pass it well

988
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:36,733
so yeah

989
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:37,533
yeah

990
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:40,300
like the ball metaphor for can be passed

991
00:34:40,366 --> 00:34:41,800
can be pitched pretty far

992
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,900
because sometimes in a professional environment

993
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,100
people will take the ball

994
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,066
and then they'll put it down and walk away

995
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,266
like that could drop the ball right

996
00:34:51,266 --> 00:34:52,066
ha ha

997
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,866
it's like somebody will do with this

998
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,600
ha ha ha also

999
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,300
there's people who collect balls

1000
00:34:56,466 --> 00:34:57,966
oh yes yes

1001
00:34:57,966 --> 00:35:00,100
oh collect more than they can handle right

1002
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,000
like this is a handful it's just like

1003
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,700
this is a beautiful football

1004
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,133
and this is a beautiful ping pong ball

1005
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:07,200
and it's like just you know

1006
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,366
collecting them

1007
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,900
yeah

1008
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,366
or like doing tricks with the ball

1009
00:35:12,366 --> 00:35:13,466
and the goal's right there

1010
00:35:13,466 --> 00:35:15,400
it was like look at all the fancy stuff I can do

1011
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,833
I can bounce it on my head

1012
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,700
so we see this a lot yeah

1013
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,700
and missed the point right

1014
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,000
like oh

1015
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
you have to put it in the goal

1016
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:23,900
I guess

1017
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:25,466
yeah I think

1018
00:35:25,466 --> 00:35:26,566
I think this is sometimes like

1019
00:35:26,566 --> 00:35:27,266
I think you can

1020
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:29,533
be quite long time in a team without having

1021
00:35:29,533 --> 00:35:30,366
especially like

1022
00:35:30,366 --> 00:35:32,866
companies that are cutting on budget and everything

1023
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,500
and I think uh

1024
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,133
let's say 10 years ago

1025
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:39,966
we were in a space where every team had a scrum master

1026
00:35:39,966 --> 00:35:42,000
an agile coach a

1027
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,333
you know five people to help the teamwork

1028
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:45,700
you know and now it's like

1029
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,766
oh you gotta do it yourself again

1030
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,366
so I think if you don't explicitly say things like

1031
00:35:50,366 --> 00:35:51,333
you know you are

1032
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:53,766
responsible for your pull request to be approved

1033
00:35:53,766 --> 00:35:55,966
by the end of the sprint if we're doing sprints

1034
00:35:55,966 --> 00:35:57,600
you know then people are like

1035
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,633
yeah yeah yeah

1036
00:35:59,666 --> 00:36:01,900
I think there is still a use in

1037
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,333
scrum masters and things like that

1038
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:05,900
but I think that people just put too much on them

1039
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:08,166
the original thinking behind scrum masters

1040
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,433
was that they would be scrum coaches

1041
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,366
more than masters

1042
00:36:11,366 --> 00:36:12,933
it's not like they're there to tell everybody

1043
00:36:12,933 --> 00:36:14,800
what to do but they're there to be a coach

1044
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:17,333
ideally get into a position

1045
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:19,166
where people don't need them so much

1046
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:20,600
but it didn't really go that way

1047
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,633
it ended up

1048
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,166
yeah things get yeah

1049
00:36:24,166 --> 00:36:25,600
I think why people hate like

1050
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,900
agile scrum is that

1051
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:30,000
because company thought that that's like a

1052
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,400
you know solve all the problem

1053
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,800
like ticket to solve all the problem

1054
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,666
but it's not so that's why like

1055
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:38,266
it's got me misused and people ended up hating them

1056
00:36:38,966 --> 00:36:39,733
yeah yeah

1057
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:41,466
got misused a lot um

1058
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:45,000
and we see that like at all implemented badly in

1059
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,800
in lots of different places where they're like cool

1060
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,866
we're gonna have sprints

1061
00:36:48,266 --> 00:36:50,366
let's have a plan for the next 10 sprints

1062
00:36:50,866 --> 00:36:52,566
what specifically are we going to do

1063
00:36:52,566 --> 00:36:54,000
in the next 10 sprints

1064
00:36:54,566 --> 00:36:55,333
and it's sprinting

1065
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,100
that means we're moving really quickly

1066
00:36:59,533 --> 00:37:03,200
but yeah but why and where are we going

1067
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,466
don't know OK

1068
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:06,233
just run OK

1069
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,266
as long as you have the ball haha

1070
00:37:08,766 --> 00:37:10,100
yeah man haha

1071
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,300
just to come back to um

1072
00:37:12,466 --> 00:37:15,133
the thing you're doing at prelude right

1073
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:17,866
you mentioned at the beginning that you're also doing

1074
00:37:17,866 --> 00:37:19,866
um mentorship for teachers

1075
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,066
so not just yeah

1076
00:37:21,066 --> 00:37:23,333
so you're going to the meta level a bit

1077
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:25,666
with the teaching yeah yeah

1078
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:26,966
so that's actually with um

1079
00:37:26,966 --> 00:37:30,866
the Guild of educators so it's a community I started um

1080
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,500
last year and I've been like

1081
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:36,266
so there is a craft to teaching well

1082
00:37:36,266 --> 00:37:39,866
and a lot of people who want to teach code

1083
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:40,866
they have the coding skill

1084
00:37:40,866 --> 00:37:43,000
but not necessarily the experience in teaching

1085
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,900
and they'll often mimic what they've already seen so um

1086
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,500
traditional education systems

1087
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,000
where you have a sage on the stage and

1088
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,933
and all of that so that's one aspect of it um

1089
00:37:52,933 --> 00:37:56,700
our understanding of what good teaching looks like

1090
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,266
has changed the way people learn and study

1091
00:37:59,266 --> 00:38:00,666
and like

1092
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:03,366
that is something that has been well studied there

1093
00:38:03,466 --> 00:38:05,200
there is science to back up

1094
00:38:05,266 --> 00:38:08,166
modern methods that many people just don't know about

1095
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:09,733
standard schooling where you get

1096
00:38:09,733 --> 00:38:11,733
everybody to move at the same pace

1097
00:38:11,733 --> 00:38:14,200
under serves most people and like it's

1098
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,300
it's not like it's all bad

1099
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,100
I mean look how many people can read

1100
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,766
that's great but it

1101
00:38:18,766 --> 00:38:20,166
it can definitely be better

1102
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:20,533
so

1103
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:23,966
part of it is about just giving good teaching skills

1104
00:38:23,966 --> 00:38:26,866
and like mental frameworks to people who want to teach

1105
00:38:26,866 --> 00:38:29,533
and giving teachers support structures as well

1106
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:32,066
like a lot of people get out of teaching

1107
00:38:32,066 --> 00:38:34,066
because they get frustrated in different ways

1108
00:38:34,066 --> 00:38:37,000
like I think the half life for teachers in the UK is

1109
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,066
7 years I stand to be corrected

1110
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,666
but I mean that's not long enough

1111
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:42,833
if we could make that half life longer

1112
00:38:42,866 --> 00:38:44,300
that would be really nice

1113
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:47,033
so supporting teachers is a big thing

1114
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,833
but then there's also um

1115
00:38:48,966 --> 00:38:51,600
there are teachers who are teaching technical stuff

1116
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,466
who aren't necessarily practitioners

1117
00:38:53,466 --> 00:38:54,666
of that technical stuff

1118
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,100
so earlier we spoke about PyCon Namibia

1119
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,700
and PyCon Namibia is really

1120
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,166
really great

1121
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:02,366
because we get to go and hang out with students

1122
00:39:02,366 --> 00:39:04,566
and show them cool things with code

1123
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:07,166
and we had this day where we were at a

1124
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:08,533
like a local school

1125
00:39:08,533 --> 00:39:11,266
and we were doing some python with the kids

1126
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,666
and a bunch of computer studies

1127
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:14,933
teachers were there as well

1128
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:18,166
and these teachers were like they were lovely

1129
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:19,666
they showed up they were hungry to learn

1130
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:22,033
they really wanted to help in lots of different ways

1131
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:24,366
but when you interacted with them

1132
00:39:24,366 --> 00:39:25,566
you could see like

1133
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:27,333
like they don't know that much Python

1134
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:28,366
they don't know

1135
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,600
that much about the thing that they're there to teach

1136
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,633
because they just don't have the experience

1137
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:37,200
and so my thinking was that if we hear those folks up

1138
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,400
with technical practitioners

1139
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,933
with developers and to say like cool

1140
00:39:40,933 --> 00:39:43,100
now you have an expert that you can speak to

1141
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,533
then that'll probably affect quite a lot of lives

1142
00:39:45,533 --> 00:39:47,300
cause one 1 teacher affects many

1143
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,900
many people and so

1144
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,266
the idea with the mentorship program

1145
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,266
is that it's a completely voluntary thing

1146
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,166
um it's not like I'm mentoring people

1147
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:56,700
and they're paying me or anything like that

1148
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,666
it's um

1149
00:39:58,133 --> 00:40:01,300
mentors can show up or potential mentors can show up

1150
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,133
and volunteer mentees can

1151
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:04,166
can show up and say like hey

1152
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:06,266
I need help and then they get matched together

1153
00:40:06,266 --> 00:40:07,866
so a mentee can be there

1154
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:09,266
because they want to learn technical skills

1155
00:40:09,266 --> 00:40:11,333
or because they want to learn teaching skills

1156
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:14,333
and a mentor can also help with either of those things

1157
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:16,466
and a mentor can be a mentee at the same time

1158
00:40:16,466 --> 00:40:17,800
that's okay now structurally

1159
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,800
like a lot of people get a little bit frightened

1160
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,933
of becoming a mentor because it's like

1161
00:40:22,933 --> 00:40:24,266
oh if I'm somebody's mentor

1162
00:40:24,266 --> 00:40:26,233
it's like this lifetime commitment

1163
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:27,800
and they're going to expect

1164
00:40:27,966 --> 00:40:29,833
hours from me every single day

1165
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,533
yeah so um

1166
00:40:31,533 --> 00:40:34,266
there's a lot that's in place to make it like

1167
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:36,966
safe for the mentors in terms of their

1168
00:40:36,966 --> 00:40:39,266
their own capacity so we'll

1169
00:40:39,266 --> 00:40:40,800
do like a matchmaking thing

1170
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,100
and a mentor and mentee will be matched together

1171
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,800
for 12 weeks that's three months

1172
00:40:44,966 --> 00:40:46,966
and at the end of that 12 week period

1173
00:40:46,966 --> 00:40:49,566
it's like it's done they can join again if they want to

1174
00:40:49,566 --> 00:40:51,800
during those 12 weeks they're expected to meet

1175
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,933
once every two weeks for like an hour

1176
00:40:53,933 --> 00:40:55,966
and so it's not a big time commitment

1177
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,266
that's the minimum commitment

1178
00:40:57,266 --> 00:40:59,366
if both the people want to meet

1179
00:40:59,366 --> 00:41:00,666
want to spend more time together

1180
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,333
that's great but it's like that is all that is required

1181
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:04,800
and then the other thing is that

1182
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,766
the burden of organizing things goes on to the mentee

1183
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:10,200
not the mentor so the mentee will say like cool

1184
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,800
we we need to meet up let's schedule something

1185
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,600
so so they'll they'll be the scheduler

1186
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,533
and they also need to

1187
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:18,000
prep the mentor before their session

1188
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,666
just by saying like

1189
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:20,366
this is roughly what I think we should talk about

1190
00:41:20,366 --> 00:41:22,366
and so the mentor doesn't go in blind

1191
00:41:22,366 --> 00:41:23,700
they can mentally prepare

1192
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:27,633
so I've run a similar structure before

1193
00:41:27,666 --> 00:41:29,466
um a similar mentorship structure before

1194
00:41:29,466 --> 00:41:32,200
when I was working at that non profit coding bootcamp

1195
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,966
where I had professional developers mentoring our

1196
00:41:35,966 --> 00:41:38,266
our baby developers and that was really lovely

1197
00:41:38,266 --> 00:41:39,966
so we match people up

1198
00:41:39,966 --> 00:41:42,000
and the 12 weeks finished and all of that

1199
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,166
and basically every single mentor

1200
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:46,466
said that they'd like to be included in the next round

1201
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,533
so it was a good experience

1202
00:41:48,533 --> 00:41:50,100
so I'm just taking the learnings from there

1203
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,966
and applying it to a slightly different domain

1204
00:41:51,966 --> 00:41:53,566
so get people to teach well

1205
00:41:53,566 --> 00:41:55,766
teach Python well specifically and um

1206
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:58,566
there are some like interesting side effects as well

1207
00:41:58,566 --> 00:42:01,300
so the Guild of educators has a discord server

1208
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,600
and there'll be a channel on there for the mentors

1209
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,166
and so the mentors can can swap notes with each other

1210
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:07,200
they can say like oh

1211
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,333
this weird thing happened

1212
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:11,033
how do we solve it or my uh

1213
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,733
my mentee is asking about this thing

1214
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:14,766
I don't know about it does anybody know about it

1215
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:18,000
so they've got people to lean on and talk to

1216
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,466
and I think

1217
00:42:18,466 --> 00:42:19,866
some really good things can come out of those

1218
00:42:19,866 --> 00:42:21,766
conversations and for me it would be really

1219
00:42:21,766 --> 00:42:24,466
really interesting to see what problems people have

1220
00:42:24,466 --> 00:42:25,766
and how they're solving them

1221
00:42:26,133 --> 00:42:27,733
that's a resource on its own okay

1222
00:42:27,733 --> 00:42:30,100
so now come the million dollar question

1223
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,500
how can someone join the Guild of educators

1224
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,866
so head to Guild of educators.org

1225
00:42:35,866 --> 00:42:37,933
you can join just as a regular member

1226
00:42:37,933 --> 00:42:39,866
there's a join us button um

1227
00:42:39,866 --> 00:42:41,066
so you can join the

1228
00:42:41,066 --> 00:42:44,266
the discord server there and you can uh

1229
00:42:44,266 --> 00:42:46,766
fill out a form there and give me your email address

1230
00:42:46,766 --> 00:42:48,166
and then you'll get emailed

1231
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:49,900
about different news and things

1232
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,733
when it happens

1233
00:42:50,733 --> 00:42:53,066
and then if you want to join the mentorship program

1234
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,066
there's a different form to fill out

1235
00:42:55,066 --> 00:42:56,200
on a different tab yeah

1236
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,900
so just go to Guild of educators.org I

1237
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,300
hope we put it somewhere

1238
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,400
like in the description or on the screen

1239
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,166
I don't know we'll

1240
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:04,466
we'll see but yeah

1241
00:43:04,466 --> 00:43:06,566
we'll get folks the information

1242
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,066
coming back to the beginning

1243
00:43:08,066 --> 00:43:10,433
where we talked about PyCon um

1244
00:43:10,566 --> 00:43:11,700
Africa Africa

1245
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:15,200
you showed us what your colleague did as a copy

1246
00:43:15,366 --> 00:43:17,833
as inspired by PyCon US

1247
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,700
and I thought that is like really cool

1248
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,700
and maybe you wanna show that awesome

1249
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,066
so at Python US and other conferences

1250
00:43:25,066 --> 00:43:25,933
you get a name tag

1251
00:43:25,933 --> 00:43:27,266
and then there are stickers and ribbons

1252
00:43:27,266 --> 00:43:28,666
that you can attach to the name tag

1253
00:43:28,666 --> 00:43:30,700
in order to say who you are

1254
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,666
to say like I'm a community member and I like hugs

1255
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:35,800
and I'm involved with PyLadies and

1256
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,300
and things like that so

1257
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,166
one of the organizers of PyCon

1258
00:43:39,166 --> 00:43:41,400
Africa is really into 3d printing

1259
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,800
it's amazing and he made these name tags

1260
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,000
so this is completely modular

1261
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,133
you can take it apart it's got these like

1262
00:43:48,133 --> 00:43:50,266
little purple things to hold everything together

1263
00:43:50,266 --> 00:43:51,800
and it just pop out oh

1264
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,166
that's really cool yeah

1265
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:54,733
and if you zoom in on this

1266
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:56,933
like this is the PyCon Africa logo

1267
00:43:56,933 --> 00:43:58,600
this was done with a 3D printer

1268
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,900
and when you print these things

1269
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,300
it's a really interesting process

1270
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,933
because you need to take um

1271
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:05,200
the transparency of the different colors into account

1272
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,300
and you can get the 3D printer to kind of

1273
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,566
mix the colors yeah

1274
00:44:08,566 --> 00:44:09,666
it's super cool

1275
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:13,366
so we have these like epic name badges and yeah

1276
00:44:13,366 --> 00:44:13,533
like

1277
00:44:13,533 --> 00:44:15,933
it comes with a little lanyard that you can click in

1278
00:44:15,933 --> 00:44:18,500
and you can say that you you like hugs

1279
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,000
I like hugs so this is yeah

1280
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,200
this is the process can we have one

1281
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:26,233
like this excuse about anything before coffee

1282
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,000
ha ha

1283
00:44:30,533 --> 00:44:31,566
so this is cool

1284
00:44:31,566 --> 00:44:33,500
it's gonna be a little keepsake for everyone as well

1285
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,533
this is the park on South Africa over there um

1286
00:44:36,533 --> 00:44:38,533
that's our national I want that now okay

1287
00:44:38,533 --> 00:44:39,700
ha ha ha yeah

1288
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,200
because at last PyCon in Germany

1289
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,966
Cheuk actually just made a really quickly

1290
00:44:45,966 --> 00:44:47,900
a website to like really quickly

1291
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:50,466
like what else do you do during a conference where she

1292
00:44:50,466 --> 00:44:54,733
she was like rating swag people could rate the swag no

1293
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:55,966
you did that Cheuk yeah

1294
00:44:55,966 --> 00:44:56,500
that that's

1295
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,700
that's more than a swag that's the name patch

1296
00:44:58,700 --> 00:44:59,700
it's so cool yeah

1297
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,766
that is yeah exactly

1298
00:45:00,766 --> 00:45:02,366
so that's like so I

1299
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,466
I need I need another session for that

1300
00:45:04,466 --> 00:45:05,266
so

1301
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:07,800
so now Cheuk needs to come to PyCon Africa

1302
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,100
see that's what you had to

1303
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,400
what you had to start with

1304
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,266
and then you get everybody to attend

1305
00:45:13,266 --> 00:45:15,300
I think this is going to become a PyCon

1306
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,733
South Africa staple I think

1307
00:45:16,733 --> 00:45:18,966
it's gonna be our standard thing, because it actually like

1308
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,533
like it takes a while to print the stuff

1309
00:45:20,533 --> 00:45:23,666
but we looked at the price of like

1310
00:45:23,666 --> 00:45:26,266
ordering name badges and things like this

1311
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:27,666
and it's actually comparable

1312
00:45:27,666 --> 00:45:28,866
it's like um

1313
00:45:28,966 --> 00:45:31,366
it's pretty close and this is only

1314
00:45:31,366 --> 00:45:32,900
this is like the first prototype

1315
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:34,966
the printing has become more efficient

1316
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:35,766
so yeah it's

1317
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:38,100
it's actually a really good way to go

1318
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,533
and it's unique and like

1319
00:45:39,533 --> 00:45:41,066
I think that's the charm of like

1320
00:45:41,066 --> 00:45:42,900
you have stuff that you made yourself

1321
00:45:42,933 --> 00:45:45,900
so two years ago at Python Pizza in Hamburg

1322
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:50,866
we did the Python Python logo shaped cookie cutters

1323
00:45:50,866 --> 00:45:51,933
also with the oh yeah

1324
00:45:51,933 --> 00:45:53,900
I I really want that one as well

1325
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,833
ha ha ha that's awesome

1326
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,966
can you do it again and then I will come

1327
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,266
I think that's really the end

1328
00:46:03,266 --> 00:46:04,466
so um

1329
00:46:04,466 --> 00:46:05,800
we have very very

1330
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,166
you know limited amount of time

1331
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:08,400
we can talk for it for ages

1332
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,900
but I guess like seeing Sheena travels a lot

1333
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:11,933
we can you know

1334
00:46:11,933 --> 00:46:13,700
next time you see her you can just

1335
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,900
you know come chat in South Africa

1336
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,833
South Africa as well yeah

1337
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,566
and um yeah

1338
00:46:20,566 --> 00:46:22,566
so thank you very much for listening

1339
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:24,366
to everybody who's listening

1340
00:46:26,266 --> 00:46:27,166
bye bye thank you

1341
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:28,800
yeah
