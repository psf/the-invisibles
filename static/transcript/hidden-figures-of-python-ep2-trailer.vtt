00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.020
So I feel that I would like to

2
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.626
make that other girl have those privileges,

3
00:00:11.626 --> 00:00:14.308
have those opportunities that at the end

4
00:00:14.308 --> 00:00:19.650
are not that privileged, are not that exclusive.

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.532
They are there, the opportunities are there, but

6
00:00:22.532 --> 00:00:25.114
we are afraid to take those challenges

7
00:00:25.114 --> 00:00:29.932
That at the very beginning could be really scary, but

8
00:00:29.932 --> 00:00:32.514
after that, you will see that you are not alone.

9
00:00:32.514 --> 00:00:36.700
We make the meetup completely open for

10
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.752
anyone that wants to join us.

11
00:00:38.752 --> 00:00:40.512
Like the girls that were in

12
00:00:40.512 --> 00:00:43.478
university were bringing them, the father,

13
00:00:43.478 --> 00:00:46.910
the grandparent, could be their brother.

14
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.928
Anyone that can be with her joining the

15
00:00:50.928 --> 00:00:54.150
meetup and helping her to feel safe.

16
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.076
You don't need to be coding all days

17
00:01:09.076 --> 00:01:12.340
to be part of the Python community.

18
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.794
Hi, everyone. I'm Karo. Karobot. And you can find me everywhere

19
00:01:14.794 --> 00:01:18.338
As Karobot, I'm a co-organizer of PyLadies

20
00:01:18.338 --> 00:01:20.338
Colombia and also the PyCon Columbia.

21
00:01:20.338 --> 00:01:22.508
I'm really happy and thrilled to be part of

22
00:01:22.508 --> 00:01:25.218
this episode of PyPodcats, so thank you, Mariatta.

23
00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:27.036
Thank you, Cheuk, for inviting me, and

24
