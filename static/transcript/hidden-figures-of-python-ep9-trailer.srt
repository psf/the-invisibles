1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,280
Because I learned Django

2
00:00:01,281 --> 00:00:02,680
and I felt so empowered.

3
00:00:02,681 --> 00:00:04,640
I was, I can do anything now.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,320
I use Python to write

5
00:00:11,321 --> 00:00:12,760
hardware bindings, which was

6
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:14,080
for music instruments.

7
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,600
Then I transitioned to doing

8
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:17,760
machine learning and NLP.

9
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:19,240
Python is very versatile.

10
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:21,160
Django was, wow, these kind

11
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:22,880
of frameworks in 2012,

12
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:24,440
2013, I was like, I can

13
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,920
build any website I want.

14
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:27,080
I think there's nothing that

15
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:28,480
fulfills me more than a room

16
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:30,320
of people and seeing them glow

17
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,360
by the end because they've

18
00:00:31,361 --> 00:00:32,266
made a PR.

19
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:33,220
PyLadies

20
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:34,380
The PyLadies.

21
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:36,380
This is one of the people, the first

22
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:37,940
people that show their welcome

23
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:39,420
and I really appreciate it.

24
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:40,460
I don't think I would have

25
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:41,820
moved if they did not

26
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:43,580
were so welcoming to me.

27
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:45,540
It's archived now on GitHub, our

28
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,460
repository from then, but you can go

29
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:48,980
and still see the type of commits

30
00:00:48,981 --> 00:00:50,940
and PRs that we did in the past.

31
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:52,180
They're not what I would do

32
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:53,780
now, but I am not embarrassed.

33
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:55,266
From my

34
00:00:55,267 --> 00:00:56,433
beginnings.

35
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:57,180
Somewhere,

36
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:59,940
somehow in one of my polytechnic

37
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:02,220
days we have basic Computer

38
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:04,099
Science and I learned C

39
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,980
there. And I un-seen it now.

40
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,260
