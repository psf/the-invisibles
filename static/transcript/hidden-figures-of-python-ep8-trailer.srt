1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,580
We should talk more about Mojdeh today.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,512
We are now five organizers.

3
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:13,336
My close friends call me Moj and my full name is Mojdeh.

4
00:00:13,337 --> 00:00:14,880
I am really happy to be part

5
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:17,120
of PyPodcats team this year.

6
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:19,216
So I was fortunate enough to get a

7
00:00:19,217 --> 00:00:22,872
scholarship and this scholarship I think still exists.

8
00:00:22,873 --> 00:00:25,240
It's called Erasmus Mundus Scholarship.

9
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:28,952
I knew about Erasmus as the Erasmus parties,

10
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:30,824
so there were a lot of parties.

11
00:00:30,825 --> 00:00:32,768
Currently I'm working as a data

12
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:36,120
scientist project manager in Saint-Gobain.

13
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:37,520
It's not really clear what does

14
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:39,260
Python have to do with glass?

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,824
I'm really looking.

16
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:43,024
Through my window right now.

17
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:45,320
I don't see any Python code.

18
00:00:45,321 --> 00:00:47,680
No one knows everything.

19
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:49,192
You have all the language models.

20
00:00:49,193 --> 00:00:50,696
You don't need to know everything anymore.

21
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:51,832
Yeah, exactly.

22
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:54,400
It is important that even if you hear it from

23
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:56,800
LLM or read it from LLM, you question it.

24
00:00:56,801 --> 00:00:59,948
Is there any episode that you particularly

25
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:02,796
like from last year from the PyPodcats?

26
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:04,884
I mean the episode that stays a lot

27
00:01:04,885 --> 00:01:07,260
in my mind is the one with Vicky.

28
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:11,084
I also like the one that Real Python

29
00:01:11,085 --> 00:01:11,916
Joanna.

30
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:14,644
For me, I didn't know her before the

31
00:01:14,645 --> 00:01:17,028
podcast and I was like, whoa, really?

32
00:01:17,029 --> 00:01:19,860
I get to know a new person. That was. Yeah, that was.

33
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:20,720
Really nice.

34
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,220
This session to introduce Mojdeh and tell you about last year

35
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:27,592
a little bit, but very a little bit and also a

36
00:01:27,593 --> 00:01:29,320
little bit more about the outlook for next year.
