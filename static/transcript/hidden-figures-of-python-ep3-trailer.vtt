00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.774
No one volunteered.

2
00:00:05.774 --> 00:00:07.454
So I said, oh, how hard could it be?

3
00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:09.574
So I took the ball and ran with it,

4
00:00:09.574 --> 00:00:12.502
and ran the Python Ireland meetups every month.

5
00:00:12.502 --> 00:00:15.238
Nearly every month for nearly over eleven years.

6
00:00:15.238 --> 00:00:17.646
I was really very privileged, in the right place at

7
00:00:17.646 --> 00:00:19.686
the right time, being able to see Python in the

8
00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.998
early days, being able to see a lot of the

9
00:00:21.998 --> 00:00:24.142
core developers. Came across them I didn't even know.

10
00:00:24.142 --> 00:00:26.046
Kind of nearly fainted when my husband told me you

11
00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:28.118
were sitting on the table with all the core developers.

12
00:00:28.118 --> 00:00:30.166
When you run a meetup, you don't have to have food

13
00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.398
if you don't need to, but you don't need your beer,

14
00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:35.294
you don't need your pizza, you don't need all those sandwiches.

15
00:00:35.294 --> 00:00:37.926
You'd be lucky if you can get company

16
00:00:37.926 --> 00:00:39.526
to host you, because normally they have a

17
00:00:39.526 --> 00:00:41.630
kitchenette. Community meant a lot to me.

18
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.486
So even though I start moving away from Python

19
00:00:44.486 --> 00:00:47.334
stuff, I always think back to how I got

20
00:00:47.334 --> 00:00:50.350
started, and that is python, the community itself.

21
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.406
What is irish tea? Is it black tea?

22
00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:53.718
I don't know if you want to keep that in

23
00:00:53.718 --> 00:00:56.182
the podcast, but it might cause a fury in Ireland.

24
00:00:56.182 --> 00:00:59.534
"I don't want to listen to Vicky anymore!"

25
00:00:59.534 --> 00:01:00.854
"She drinks irish tea!"

26
00:01:00.854 --> 00:01:02.902
Vicky here from PyLadies and Coding Grace and

27
00:01:02.902 --> 00:01:04.934
Thanks for having me on PyPodcats

28
00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:07.214
I hope you enjoy this episode. Thanks.
