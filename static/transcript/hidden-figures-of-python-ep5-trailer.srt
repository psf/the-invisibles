1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,790
 Do you also have a special affinity towards dinosaurs? 

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,230
           Actually I am very scared of           

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,960
        dinosaurs I refused to watch               

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,340
     dinosaur movies it scares me a lot     

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,470
 I started learning how to code around the 

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,110
time I graduated from kinder I was maybe around five years old

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,070
  Being young also makes it easier for me   

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,150
  to talk to kids I guess especially when I  

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,580
  teach workshops and when I hold hackathons 

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,190
 I guess it helps me relate to them more and 

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,470
     come up with activities that they would       

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,720
             find fun    Being young is                   

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,990
   kind of inspires them if I can do all of    

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,950
   these things then so can they I guess  

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,430
 when people have mental health concerns it's  

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,300
   always really challenging to try and reach out        

17
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,390
to the appropriate support and so with TEDDY I hope to 

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,150
 make it so that it's easier for counselors 

19
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,430
 to figure out which students to reach out and to help

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,430
 Instead of using a computer to write their code

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,470
  Each student is given a piece of paper where they

22
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,590
 can write down their program basically and then

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,470
  after that the teacher will just scan it and upload it 

24
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,040
                      onto one computer and                  

25
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,710
 run it and that way students will be able  

26
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,950
        to see it come to life on the digital          

27
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,190
     screens it's not the case that you need       

28
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,950
      like 40 computers for one classroom you      

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,470
   actually only need one you're making it   

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,270
  more accessible through public schools and  

31
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:02,870
   rural communities   

32
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,310

37
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,150
 and to this end I'm also a student

and workshops for kids to get started

43
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,610
 with coding
