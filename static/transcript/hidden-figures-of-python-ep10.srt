1
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:17,760
None.

2
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,680
Hello PyPodcast,

3
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,120
Today we are very honoured to have Una with us.

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,800
Una, do you want to introduce yourself? Oh.

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,080
Still a human being.

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,680
She is a superstar in PyLadies Amsterdam.

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,120
She is doing everything for PyLadies

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,920
Amsterdam and I'll let you talk.

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,520
Hi everyone, I'm UNA.

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,640
I'm running apparently PyLadies Amsterdam for

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,160
Oh my God, like longer than six years.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,000
No,

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,680
no, no way.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,880
And the 7th is coming soon.

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,880
Apparently the seven years is coming

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,760
starting from May.

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,360
So OK, now I can officially say

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,920
7 years. Yeah.

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:58,840
Wow 7.

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,480
Years.

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,120
Seven years is like longer than my visa, so

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,560
that's a lot.

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,520
So I can assume and say that's now she went

24
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,880
to the basic school, you know.

25
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:12,640
Yeah,

26
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,000
yeah, if you think of, you

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,320
know, PyLadies is your baby, then yeah,

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,320
it's now, you know, in school and.

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,680
Sometimes it's feel like

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,440
I still try to distribute the load, but

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,400
sometimes it feels like this indeed.

32
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,360
Let's learn a little bit more about

33
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:28,960
yourself.

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,240
Have you been living in Amsterdam for a

35
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,080
long time?

36
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,320
Yep, I relocated to Amsterdam 11 years ago.

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,320
So

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,800
I think that was the love from the first

39
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,160
sight, you know? And it was

40
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,960
I talking about Amsterdam,

41
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,960
not about a person.

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,720
Unless you want to personalize Amsterdam of

43
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,080
course, or personificates I guess.

44
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,600
Not personalized or personific.

45
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,400
I think the Amsterdam has very unique

46
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,080
opportunities in the sense of meetup

47
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,280
saying, but at the same time it has a lot

48
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,000
of pros and cons. Pros.

49
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,480
There is a group of people who just

50
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,520
attended meetups just for the sake of

51
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:02,920
eating.

52
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,600
It's everywhere.

53
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,280
It's everywhere, not just Amsterdam, I'm

54
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:07,760
telling you.

55
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,320
Apparently, Yeah, apparently. And

56
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,280
it's really saturated.

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,280
It was saturated before COVID.

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,160
During the COVID it was less, let's say,

59
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,800
active.

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,760
After the COVID, it's saturated again.

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,640
Sometimes you have to make choices like

62
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,760
where do I want to go? Oh my gosh, There is

63
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,840
like 3 or 4 really interesting events and

64
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,480
they all happen at the same time and not

65
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,680
all the events making recordings and you

66
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,480
know, sometimes just like the information

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,480
in the states within.

68
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,200
So yeah, I think

69
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,080
for me it was really, really important to find.

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,640
I was not looking specifically for a

71
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,280
community.

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,360
I was it's more more like, you know, the

73
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,080
quest for knowledge.

74
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,560
And it was like, oh, by the way, like we

75
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,240
had a lot of events, but all the events are

76
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,920
talks, which is fantastic.

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,760
I do agree.

78
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,200
But at the same time, you after the whole

79
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,480
work day, you go to this talks and the

80
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,560
talks go through like direction One,

81
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,200
Direction two direction 3.

82
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,640
And like, at the end of the day, your brain

83
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,640
is struggling, you know, to, to get all

84
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,760
these concepts together.

85
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,720
So you're feeling that you start fuzzing

86
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,000
out on the talk #3 if it was your good day,

87
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,840
and if it was your bad day, you start

88
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,360
fazing out on the talk #1 And also a big

89
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,600
amount of talks are going about like, oh,

90
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,520
look at this cool feature.

91
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,040
Like just subscribe to a premium, you know,

92
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,280
and you're gonna get that.

93
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,920
Or look how some things I've done and like

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,280
when I start asking questions.

95
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,920
But like, what were your, you know, the

96
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,640
thought process? What is pros and cons like?

97
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,360
Yeah, you're saying that just use this

98
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,080
awesome library.

99
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,760
Fantastic.

100
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,600
That's how it's compared to others.

101
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,080
Like, why this? Why that?

102
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,960
But you were working in tech before you

103
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,800
moved to Amsterdam?

104
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,120
Right.

105
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,920
Oh yeah, yeah,

106
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,320
that's that's the thing.

107
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,360
I was already there.

108
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,040
I usually joking that I'm, you know, like

109
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,720
the the person who's there and not there at

110
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,440
the same time.

111
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,920
I'm usually trying to, let's say merge both

112
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,720
words and like if I look back, it's my

113
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,280
career.

114
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,200
I think I tried almost all.

115
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,080
I was only mentioning that I didn't try PhD yet,

116
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,000
but for the rest,

117
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,200
like working for myself, working for

118
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,960
someone else, starting my own company,

119
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,640
growing my own company, selling my own

120
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,160
company,

121
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,960
get into another one.

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,080
And by the way, my first job in the

123
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,120
Netherlands was an executive director.

124
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,760
Yeah, that's how I ended up here.

125
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,320
But then after that I was like, Nah, you

126
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,840
know, I'm just done.

127
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,480
I did some stuff for myself, but now I want

128
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,440
to do something for somebody else.

129
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,520
And that's how I start freelancing.

130
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,600
But I was really scared to start freelancing

131
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,920
in the Netherlands because I was like,

132
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,120
it's a small country in case I deliver

133
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,280
really shitty product.

134
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,800
Or really, should

135
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,880
you know what people gonna do?

136
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,600
OK.

137
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,280
Do you feel like it's it will close it down

138
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,560
opportunities If you

139
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,440
like you didn't do well the first time is

140
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,880
do you feel like it will close it down for you?

141
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah, it's like it's such a tiny country.

142
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,520
So basically the majority of the folks you

143
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,200
know them are just rotation of the brains

144
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,600
between like the big players

145
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,720
and why referring to the big players? I do

146
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,760
not mean funk companies, I mean just like

147
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,640
the the big players on the local markets,

148
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,080
whether it's like international companies

149
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,200
or local enterprises.

150
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,920
But the majority of them there are some

151
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,640
bunch of really like interesting unicorns,

152
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,440
for example.

153
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,680
And then they're basically migration as a

154
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,800
mention of the brain.

155
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,200
Like you go there, then they go there, then

156
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,800
when they fed up doing that, they go there.

157
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,440
So there is also like this consulting

158
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,480
world, which is like slightly different, but

159
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,680
it's almost the same I would say.

160
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,840
And and yeah, that's how you get it.

161
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,560
I was very, very like early in my

162
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,120
career.

163
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,760
I was actually considering moving to

164
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,680
Amsterdam and looking for a job there, but

165
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,960
I have been told that if you want to work

166
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,920
in a consultancy you have to speak Dutch.

167
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,760
So how's your Dutch?

168
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I would say really "geth so"

169
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,720
I don't think that's the audience going to

170
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,120
pick it up,

171
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,520
at least the majority of the audience.

172
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,960
It's true in case you are aiming for like

173
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,000
very top senior positions, it's very, very

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,040
true because when you need to interact

175
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,960
directly with let's say C level, C minus

176
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,440
level stakeholders, if it's a Dutch

177
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,400
company, they will be Dutch.

178
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,360
If it's an international company with some

179
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,440
like offices here,

180
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,040
they also would be Dutch.

181
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,360
And somehow everyone here is bilingual,

182
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,280
but they prefer to speak Dutch.

183
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,320
And if you don't

184
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,280
get it,

185
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,520
you can lose a lot of,

186
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,240
you know, a lot of nuances.

187
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,560
That's that's true, But I wouldn't say that

188
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,520
it's true if you're not interacting direct

189
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,000
with stakeholders unless unless you're

190
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,400
joining some kind of

191
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,440
just outsourcing company that's, you know,

192
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,040
basically don't care about you.

193
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,080
They're just selling you per hour and

194
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,640
earning the margin on top of it.

195
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,360
But it's also like it's their business.

196
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,000
That's how they operate in this case.

197
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,760
They want to hire you as cheap as possible.

198
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,200
They want to sell you as

199
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,000
expensive as possible.

200
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,280
Yeah, it is what it is.

201
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,640
Yeah, it sounds really tough, but

202
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,040
that's what make me want to know more about

203
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,080
your journey when you

204
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,280
first moved to Amsterdam. Like,

205
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,440
do you already have a job or you

206
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,440
already have your own company? Like

207
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,320
so where were you at that

208
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,560
point in time?

209
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,320
Yeah. So when

210
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,760
at that point in time, I, I sold my company

211
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,360
and I was basically looking for a job and I

212
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,240
was looking for a job that will help me,

213
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,680
you know, to relocate myself.

214
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,040
And there's also like my partner was also

215
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,560
at that moment we're looking for a job.

216
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,920
So we're like, OK, so if we find then we

217
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,480
are moving because we didn't want, you

218
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,680
know, to just move.

219
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,240
We wanted to move with the good conditions

220
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,160
under good circumstances because I'm

221
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,000
originally not from,

222
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,320
let's say EU country, which makes it

223
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,000
usually very hot.

224
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
It's very hard, but it's way harder than if

225
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,480
you just like do transfer within EU.

226
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,400
Because like if you're from you, you can go

227
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,480
and work in any place.

228
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,240
You just need to do some registrations to

229
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,760
get some tax numbers and everything.

230
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,200
But for the rest, you're free to go.

231
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,960
Even if you have your passports.

232
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,480
You can go, for example, and work in

233
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,760
Scandinavian countries as well.

234
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
So you don't need to have visa that separate thing

235
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,680
unless it's Great Britain.

236
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,640
That's completely.

237
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,080
Sorry.

238
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,240
Yes, yes, I'm looking at you now like

239
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,760
Queen, Queen.

240
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,080
Actually, like we also take a hit.

241
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,760
So I mean who lose more?

242
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,520
Never know.

243
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,160
Yeah. So

244
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,720
I mentioned like that my first job in the

245
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,440
Netherlands was an executive director.

246
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,640
So it was basically a

247
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,840
service company.

248
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,120
You're doing a lot of things, but their

249
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,960
goal was to build the company was from

250
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,920
scratch, which was really valuable.

251
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,120
Because I get through all this, you know, I

252
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,680
get to experience bureaucracy first hand.

253
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,720
But I wouldn't say that it's a lot of

254
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,240
bureaucracy.

255
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,440
At least what I'm hearing, for example,

256
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,480
from the colleagues who live in Germany, it's

257
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,040
it's completely different story.

258
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,120
So I would say there is a bureaucracy, yes. I see.

259
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,080
Yeah, because

260
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,560
I also have a good friend who live in

261
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,880
Germany and you know, these two country I

262
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,320
think is the top 2 competing who have more

263
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,080
bureaucracy.

264
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,880
Yeah, something like I would say something

265
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,760
like that indeed.

266
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,640
And then I was like, OK, so yeah, which is

267
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,480
how the tech scheme looks like.

268
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,520
What can I do? What are the companies and

269
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,560
the Netherlands like some major players,

270
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,000
you know, like ASML

271
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,600
you have like Phillips, that's like they

272
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,200
were the majority of the folks are gone.

273
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,440
They have like okay, booking.com and like

274
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,120
this, you know, big dinosaurs.

275
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,040
Let's put in this way.

276
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,800
So and there are other options of course,

277
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,120
and there are

278
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,920
more local options. And

279
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,800
I was like, yeah, what should I do? And

280
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,640
then I was like, no, I want to go, I want

281
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,480
to feel freedom.

282
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,240
So I'm going to go freelancing, which was

283
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,280
really strange decision because it came with

284
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,600
some changes of the residence permits

285
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,800
by default, like if you're located in

286
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,560
specific capacity, you're not allowed to do

287
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,600
to work in for yourself.

288
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,920
So there are like a lot of things.

289
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,080
So I found a way to do that like legally

290
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,720
and officially.

291
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,400
And as I mentioned that back then, I was a

292
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,280
little little bits like afraid of

293
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,840
doing something on the local market because

294
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,600
I didn't know how rusty I am.

295
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,640
You know, rusty not in the sense that doing

296
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,640
things with Rust like in the opposite

297
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,320
direction,

298
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,760
not related to Rust language,

299
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,600
the pun intended joke.

300
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,120
So,

301
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,840
and I was like, yeah, where are you going

302
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,840
to go? And like where have friends, they're

303
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,600
going to help me.

304
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,280
Like I just want to deliver.

305
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,680
Good job, you know, and I don't want to

306
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,840
look for the clients or something.

307
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
I was looking for some

308
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,320
kind of low ending fruits.

309
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,200
And apparently the friends of mine, they

310
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,320
were like, oh, just, you know,

311
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,120
like if you're interested, it's like we're

312
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,520
working with the United States,

313
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,360
so we're working with American markets.

314
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,760
If you're interested, go there, you know,

315
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:23,600
go there.

316
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,800
I mean, stay here, but

317
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,800
go there and do some stuff. And

318
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,080
I was like, yeah, I was really, really

319
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,560
excited.

320
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,400
So basically for me legally, it was really

321
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,840
easy because my,

322
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,920
all my, let's say relationships were with a

323
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,760
local company,

324
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,440
which, you know, protect me from

325
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:36,960
everything.

326
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,280
So in case something happened with the

327
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,440
money or clients, it's not my problem, it's

328
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,160
their problem.

329
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,840
Like they were handling everything for me.

330
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,320
So I would say that was for Lancing, but

331
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,600
it's still like working for someone else,

332
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,120
but like with some freedom to say no to

333
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,240
specific clients and like, let's let's say

334
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,840
like that.

335
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,400
And that was funny because you working with

336
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
people online, there is huge time

337
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,040
difference.

338
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,680
That's where it caught my attention because

339
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,760
when we started doing meetings online,

340
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,280
people were surprised to know that I'm

341
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:06,960
female.

342
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,480
Somehow they were expecting just, you know,

343
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,160
another guy.

344
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,440
It's a cliche, but it's still, it's still.

345
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,840
And there was like, oh, are you? Oh,

346
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,960
we didn't expect this is like, what do you

347
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,320
mean by?

348
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,360
Oh my God,

349
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,240
I think, I think

350
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,760
people don't check LinkedIn.

351
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,600
But like, you know, at that time, right?

352
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,400
It's not like now people will check your

353
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,800
LinkedIn before talking to you. Oh.

354
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,320
Boy, yeah, I I think there is like, yeah, that's

355
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,240
like, who are you? I was like my

356
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,640
you're engineer, you know,

357
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:36,520
or

358
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,000
you

359
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:37,560
can.

360
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,080
You tell us about this freelancing job

361
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,960
specifically.

362
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,440
Like what do you do as a freelancer?

363
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,800
So there was 1 gig was pure data

364
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,440
engineering.

365
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,800
So basically you have

366
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,400
you do sensor fusion or a lot of sensor

367
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,280
data coming in, you need to process it very

368
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,440
sparse data and then you ship it to the

369
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,200
data scientist.

370
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,760
They're going to build different like time

371
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,680
series, like statistical and machine like using

372
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,680
different machine learning algorithms on

373
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,240
top of that.

374
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,760
That was like the first one gig.

375
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,160
It was approximately 4 or five months

376
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,000
and then I was dragged into the more, let's

377
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,360
say ML related gig.

378
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,440
Again, there are like data scientists and

379
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,440
they're struggling to put things in

380
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,120
production.

381
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,040
Could you help us to go there, You know,

382
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,560
set up some like bring some software

383
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,960
engineering practices in place.

384
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,720
Help us like with CICD pipeline

385
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,480
specifically for machine learning training,

386
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,960
introduce continuous training where it's

387
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,920
possible set up specific metrics and

388
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,200
threshold for monitoring.

389
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,240
And that was really interesting because at

390
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,600
that moment that was a very, very awesome

391
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,160
project.

392
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,600
I was working with self driving trucks and

393
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,720
that was like, whoa, that's where I learned

394
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,440
first time in my life what LiDAR is

395
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,760
before that, I have no clue.

396
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,920
Like that this thing that do this like

397
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,960
365°, like your

398
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,080
3D coordination position.

399
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,360
And then it's basically allows you, let's

400
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,160
say to see.

401
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,880
And then you can run on this like

402
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,720
combination of computer vision algorithms

403
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,880
together with all this, let's say a sensor

404
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,920
data that coming in like combination of that.

405
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,520
And you get like the, the full picture of

406
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,280
what's going on.

407
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,400
That I think was for me really, really eyes

408
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,000
opening

409
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,440
because you know, before that, like what's

410
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,880
the problem? You just say don't hit,

411
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,960
don't hit this

412
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,400
very cool.

413
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,000
And after that I jump on the different

414
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,720
things so I get him back to more like

415
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,200
maritime industry and that was the moment of

416
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,440
help to predict the best time for crew

417
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,080
rotation.

418
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,240
So you have like

419
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,680
crew who stays for a longer term on the

420
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,280
ship and when ship arrives to specific

421
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,000
coast, you need to take an account the

422
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,480
weather, taking account a nationality of

423
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,400
the crew that has to be rotated taking into

424
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,640
account visit conditions of the country.

425
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,560
They think they're gonna port at plus like

426
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,160
weather condition.

427
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,080
And I mentioned like condition also like

428
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,000
all the ocean.

429
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,720
How is it how it's like behaving, how it's

430
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,720
working? And then what is the probability

431
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,480
that the ship going to be at this port

432
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,560
versus that ports? What is the most, let's

433
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,400
say, optimal condition for rotation, which

434
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,680
can saves a lot of money or which can even

435
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,960
prevent rotation of the crew? For example,

436
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,280
visa regime is not

437
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,160
favorable.

438
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,280
Also, you get a lot of like repair teams.

439
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,440
So there are a lot of repairs that happens

440
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,280
as soon as the ship is moving.

441
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,200
So there are big repairs that you do in,

442
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,960
for example, in different types of docks,

443
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,560
but there are also repairs and go.

444
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,800
So imagine like like the folks that flying

445
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,240
with like this very excessive baggage and

446
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,880
then for example, they losing it back.

447
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,320
And the bag has like all the tools, like,

448
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,800
you know, like the tools, cost of the

449
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,080
tools, just like, yeah,

450
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:27,640
like

451
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,200
they were they were tags in it.

452
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,440
The bags was also secured because it's very

453
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,080
expensive.

454
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,000
But still, you know, it's like depends on

455
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,800
their company.

456
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,640
Like do they have like the specific

457
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,400
tracking? Do they have if the luggage is

458
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,040
lost, it's usually not a problem of our

459
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,440
company.

460
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,200
It's a problem of

461
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,600
handling company at the airports and the

462
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,440
majority of the cases it is what it is,

463
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,360
yeah.

464
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,920
It's simpler, complicated.

465
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,000
I think that's I never thought that you

466
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,600
need to like the way you describe this

467
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,920
managing, you know, ship crews as they port

468
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,560
because I, you know, I enjoy cruise ships.

469
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,800
Like I've only done it a few times, but it is

470
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,360
a very big production

471
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,320
to me.

472
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Like managing the shipping cruise.

473
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,160
There was some

474
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,960
Netflix shows to show just how they run the

475
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,160
restaurants inside the cruise ship planning

476
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,680
meal or logistics.

477
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,480
Because once you're inside the ship, you

478
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,320
don't get to reload or something.

479
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,840
So now you're talking about the actual crew

480
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,600
management using, I guess as a software

481
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,320
engineer, you,

482
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,640
you write some program for that.

483
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,400
That's kind of fascinating.

484
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,120
Do you use Python for all?

485
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,560
Partially

486
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,400
like when it's possible, but you know, the

487
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,760
fancy is when I decided that I don't want

488
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,480
to do freelancing anymore and I just want

489
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,880
to work for a local company.

490
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,360
I went back to consulting because I

491
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,680
couldn't find a company that gonna satisfy,

492
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,840
you know, my needs.

493
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,520
And that like was awesome topics that I

494
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,280
would work at.

495
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,040
And that's how I joined the consulting.

496
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,760
Like the local consulting company, let's

497
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,200
say it was an outsourcing company.

498
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,760
It's still an outsourcing company, but they

499
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,400
also have like this separate department

500
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,480
called the TN Innovation.

501
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,960
That's where I landed and that's where I

502
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,960
get an opportunity to build whole things from

503
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,360
almost let's say from scratch.

504
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,040
And that's where I switch to working with

505
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,640
aircrafts.

506
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,160
So like now you can think about each

507
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,760
aircraft.

508
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,600
So how much food should we put in it? How

509
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,480
much water,

510
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,720
how much fuel, let's say based on the

511
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,840
amount of passenger that's right for for

512
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,200
registration, should we swap an aircraft?

513
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,320
You know how the operations of the airport

514
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,400
is going to run knowing what is expected

515
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,200
amount of passengers from, let's say from

516
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,280
the local air company.

517
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,680
So it's.

518
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,680
A random question.

519
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,400
Yeah, go on.

520
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,880
I have heard in my previous job that a lot

521
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,160
of, you know, air traffic planning is using

522
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,720
Prologue.

523
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,640
Is that true? Do you know or you don't

524
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,360
touch that part of craziness?

525
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,320
I touch this parts, I touch this part

526
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,680
because I would say that one of my latest

527
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,160
gigs was redesigning basically the whole

528
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,920
data in AI system for a very big fun

529
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,640
European company which is controlling

530
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,480
European sky.

531
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,560
Like there are a lot of things going on there.

532
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,440
They solving problems

533
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,800
that are not

534
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,080
common and they're solving very unique

535
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:05,680
problems.

536
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,480
That's why there is a lot of custom built

537
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,800
stuff because otherwise the way how the

538
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,920
information is shared, like how you can

539
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,120
parse it, which makes it very, very

540
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,520
difficult and completely different from

541
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:16,920
others.

542
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,920
You even can have like up to 12 languages

543
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,960
used for different components because what

544
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,360
they do, you know, the the funniest part, I

545
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,880
never thought about airspace like that.

546
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,880
They calculate airspace and they create

547
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,040
like cubes and they calculate the capacity

548
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,240
of each cube to flow through it.

549
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,160
And each cube is operated by

550
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,000
like ATC or a combination of cubes is

551
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,960
operated by ITC by this like the air 

552
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,080
traffic control tower.

553
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,400
And basically when the aircraft is flying

554
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,640
the ATC, just passing it from one chunk of

555
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,760
cubes to another chunk of cubes.

556
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,040
Like next time I have a delay in my flight

557
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,040
I would think of you so.

558
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:55,600
Yes.

559
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,680
Wait, wait,

560
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,240
wait, don't think of me

561
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,120
think about the cubes.

562
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,480
That's.

563
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,000
Where?

564
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,720
Yes.

565
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,600
Because of the weather or because of the

566
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,000
other things.

567
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,680
But you know where you can hear that? So

568
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,680
for example, when the pilot says, oh sorry,

569
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,600
we just missed our time slot for departure,

570
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,160
that's exactly they missed their claimed

571
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,120
space in a cube.

572
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:16,480
Oh, yeah,

573
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,080
that's happened a lot.

574
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,080
Like when after, you know, the pandemic and

575
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,760
also during the

576
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,520
summer season, it happens a lot, especially with

577
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,320
some flight company that is really cheap

578
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,280
and start with an hour.

579
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,000
It happens a lot.

580
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,480
We're not going to pick up the topic of

581
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,080
Coldplay and they are

582
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,120
divorcing couples, right?

583
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,160
I was just looking at that the other day.

584
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,080
Yes,

585
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,640
it's

586
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,360
yeah.

587
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,520
Let's not gossip about it,

588
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:48,600
yeah?

589
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,800
Let's change the topic. Yeah.

590
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,280
What spark? You started PyLadies in

591
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,760
Amsterdam.

592
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,520
You know,

593
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,920
it sounds really strange, but the smells

594
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,040
and the sounds.

595
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,320
So I was attending a lot of meetups.

596
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,920
Usually I was mostly one or maybe like

597
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,560
there were two of us there

598
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,760
let's say, that can be identified as females if I

599
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,000
put in this way.

600
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,600
And the majority of the meetups starting

601
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,080
with guys drinking a lot of beer and eating

602
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,920
very bad quality pizza.

603
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,880
But like, I know it's still like free of

604
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,040
charge food, but it's like very, very bad.

605
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,200
And at that moment I was not drinking

606
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,480
alcohol at all.

607
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,160
So for me, it was really problematic

608
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,360
because I was smelling it and I was

609
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,760
smelling and the beer and the pizza and the

610
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,120
guys, I'm

611
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,720
sorry.

612
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,240
I'm just in the sense I can imagine it's

613
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,960
really tough, yeah.

614
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,760
Especially something

615
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,080
related to kubernetes.

616
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,720
Somehow there is a correlation.

617
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,760
I mean kubernetes admins.

618
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,640
I'm not talking just about the developers

619
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,120
that use,

620
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:50,640
but

621
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,280
just.

622
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,560
Say you know how the place very hot, you

623
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,200
know it's not not going to be nice.

624
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:55,600
Yeah.

625
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,120
And I was like, what if there could be meet

626
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,680
up where first it would be not about talks,

627
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,880
it would be mostly about doing still doing

628
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,880
something, doing some exercises like trying

629
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,800
out a learning new concept, not just

630
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,720
watching a demo.

631
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,640
Like I wanted something that I can, you

632
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,200
know, like run, it's runs on my machine,

633
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:12,720
so.

634
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,040
Or OK, or if you need some specific

635
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,680
credits, like to run it somewhere else.

636
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,000
And I wanted to have a space where I can

637
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,760
influence a bit the food and the drinks.

638
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,680
I was not saying that's like I am against

639
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,360
alcohol.

640
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,600
It's not about that.

641
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,280
It's more about it's OK to have alcohol,

642
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,720
but at the end during the networking part

643
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,760
and not during the event.

644
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,360
Because if you aim to do workshops, then

645
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,640
you know, that's something different.

646
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,600
So that was my idea and I'm really thankful

647
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,680
that that moment I meet another person who

648
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,160
was like, so if we both dissatisfied,

649
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,720
why not to start something new? And we're

650
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,400
like, OK, So what should we do? How we

651
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,840
should do it? Like should we create a meet

652
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,800
up group? And then then what's where to

653
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,000
advertise it? I don't know, go to the

654
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,240
events and talk.

655
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,720
Oh, we have this cool idea, just go through it.

656
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,600
And there was like other any low hanging

657
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,680
fruits or something.

658
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,960
And next to it, I would say my desire was

659
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,120
to see more, let's say, female and

660
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,120
underepresented groups on the stage, you

661
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,360
know, taking the spots and not just being

662
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,800
somebody's like, assistant or something

663
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,360
like that.

664
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,800
And I was like, yeah, maybe there's

665
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,400
something.

666
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,640
And then just like with a short discovery,

667
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,560
we noticed, oh, there was a PyLadies

668
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,880
Amsterdam chapter.

669
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,560
Unfortunately, they somehow like stopped

670
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,880
their activities into southern,

671
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:31,640
just

672
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,080
to southern footing.

673
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,280
Yeah, I guess something like that.

674
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,200
There was some folks running it.

675
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,040
So I really thankful that they started it

676
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,240
and we're like, oh, could we resurrect the

677
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,480
zombie horse, you know?

678
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,680
And that's how we started.

679
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,720
And what was really funny today when I was

680
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,280
chatting, sending DMS to Marietta, I

681
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,440
scrolled down and I noticed my first

682
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,240
message to her like saying, hello, I'm

683
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,840
doing this.

684
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,800
I'm trying to get access to here and there.

685
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,360
Could you help me? Thank you for

686
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,280
understanding.

687
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,520
It was so

688
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,320
nice to see it.

689
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:03,880
Thank you. Yeah.

690
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:04,800
Yeah.

691
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,040
I

692
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,480
think that's the same.

693
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,880
I've heard these stories a lot, like

694
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,080
everything you said, you know, like we all

695
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,000
hear, we want to see more people who we can

696
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,440
relate to, you know, want to see more women

697
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,680
in the community.

698
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,080
There are

699
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,200
lots of PyLadies chapters worldwide who

700
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,400
just, you know, people started it, maybe

701
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,720
they have other priorities afterwards.

702
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,360
And then it got dormant.

703
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,240
And I'm really glad to hear that, you know,

704
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,120
you picked it up and then you run it and

705
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,600
you have your own vision of, you know, kind

706
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,880
of community you want.

707
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,760
I think that's really good to hear.

708
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,840
I'm more used to hear of people

709
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
complaining,

710
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,200
like saying there should be something for

711
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,520
me here, Like, I want an event like this.

712
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,480
You should be running an event the way I

713
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:46,920
want it.

714
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,160
But yet they're not running it themselves.

715
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,920
They're just saying you should run

716
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,800
conference like this, this and that.

717
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,560
But when we ask them, why don't you help

718
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,040
out? Why don't you run it? They say no, I'm busy.

719
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:57,880
Of.

720
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,720
Course. So

721
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,440
I'm really thankful that you are actually

722
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:01,960
doing it.

723
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,680
There is a lot of people who are telling me

724
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,160
it's not going to work like workshops, it's

725
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,240
impossible to do.

726
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,400
I mean like workshops, they have to prepare

727
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,120
first.

728
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,120
You need to find someone who wants to give

729
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,200
it like free of charge.

730
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,160
It's a lot of work.

731
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,680
You need

732
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,960
to with a lot of like trial and errors to

733
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,040
get, you know, what's the

734
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,440
like, how to do it.

735
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,960
Like what are the formats that going to

736
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,440
work, what's going to work, what's going to

737
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,960
work? And but everybody will tell me it's

738
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,600
impossible.

739
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,960
And especially if you want more like

740
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,240
underrepresented groups running in the

741
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,160
workshops. No,

742
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,600
you know, no way.

743
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,520
Like it's not gonna work.

744
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,840
But what I learned, you know, the compound

745
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,040
effect, that's what works.

746
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,640
So if you go in no matter what, and if

747
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,560
you're delivering, people start noticing you.

748
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,760
People start talking about you.

749
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,920
And what is for me is really, really eye

750
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,680
opening.

751
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,960
Before COVID, all the events were in

752
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,560
person.

753
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,480
We were not doing recordings because it was

754
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,520
too hard to set up.

755
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,920
Everything back then was like, oh, no, you

756
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,280
know, just you're just doing it.

757
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,880
And you constantly was looking for

758
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,760
sponsors.

759
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,400
Like who's going to pay, you know, who's

760
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,160
going to host, who's going to feed

761
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,040
us,

762
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,720
let's say in our workshop givers and

763
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
workshop takers.

764
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,840
And that was constant like, oh, there was a

765
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,920
list of companies.

766
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,640
We tried to reach out to the big companies.

767
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,080
They say no because they were more

768
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,840
interested in like events that's going to

769
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,520
attract 150 people versus event that

770
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,680
attracts 60 people because we have this 60

771
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,800
people Max capacity for in person events.

772
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,320
Otherwise for the workshop, it's really

773
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,080
hard to handle.

774
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,000
If you want to help, if you want to support

775
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,720
people, then you know that's not going to

776
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,040
happen.

777
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,280
Was more than 60.

778
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,520
At least that's what we learn and always like.

779
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,600
As soon as COVID started, we didn't stop

780
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,920
when a lot of communities just closed or

781
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,680
shut it down.

782
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,560
We just switched online and we start

783
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,400
experiencing the beauty of doing things

784
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,720
online because that's where we realize, oh,

785
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,640
by the way,

786
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,360
in case there is no one to host you, you

787
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,200
can host yourself online.

788
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,240
And then the people are saying, no, online

789
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,280
is not gonna work.

790
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,320
People not gonna show up for the events.

791
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,960
You know, there's, I was like, look, if

792
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,280
we're just doing online events, we now have

793
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,520
a capability of recording it.

794
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,560
So now you're recording it and there's also

795
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,440
a video record of it.

796
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,040
Although there are still a lot of ads on

797
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,400
YouTube.

798
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,880
And notice if you add in time stamps, then

799
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,360
it slightly decreased the amount of ads

800
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,320
that you get because it's also correlated

801
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,040
to a lot of factors like do you have like

802
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,440
paid ads or whenever we don't,

803
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,680
we don't use that.

804
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,120
So in this case, we just you just get like

805
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,960
general ones.

806
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,200
You keep repo open.

807
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,640
Of course, some materials could be

808
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,240
outdated.

809
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,880
So we usually encourage people if you try

810
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,400
in our workshop, something doesn't work,

811
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
please open PR, you know, just do that.

812
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,040
So you're going to help yourself and you're

813
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,360
going to help others because you know, the

814
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,840
methods got deprecated.

815
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,400
Other things are going to happen to the

816
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,040
materials.

817
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,760
For example, we were heavily using called

818
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,640
mini-conda in the beginning just for the

819
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,520
setup and everything.

820
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,600
Then we switch to poetry, then we switch to uv.

821
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,920
So like we also like migrating stuff, but

822
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,520
we couldn't migrate, migrate everything.

823
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,840
But yeah, I think that's was the beauty of it.

824
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,600
And then after COVID,

825
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,520
like as soon as you can do more stuff, we

826
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,520
basically switch to we're not looking

827
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,400
specifically for anyone to host our

828
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,760
workshops, company usually reaching out to us.

829
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,840
If no, no one reaching out to us, then

830
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,960
super simple like we just do online.

831
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,560
And it also help you to get workshop givers

832
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,200
from different countries as well.

833
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
So that's also the beauty of that.

834
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,120
These are all

835
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,920
very good advice, yeah.

836
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,400
I remember last here at PyData Amsterdam

837
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,600
when I was at the booth.

838
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,080
So there's a booth for π ladies.

839
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,600
And then she's asking every ladies that she

840
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,000
talked to.

841
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,040
You want to give a workshop? And this, this is.

842
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,480
Yeah,

843
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,800
this is like stuck in my head.

844
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:26,640
Yeah.

845
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,280
I.

846
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,440
Think, you know, really good,

847
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,080
Yeah.

848
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,480
I think what's stuck in my head, last year

849
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,160
I was at EuroPython, so it was like it's π

850
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,800
ladies booth

851
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,160
and I think I had like 4:00 lights in the

852
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,600
morning, something like that.

853
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,120
So I was not in my best mood.

854
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,080
So I came and that was like my analytical

855
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,160
me in the full force, which is not really

856
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,160
compatible, you know, with human beings

857
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,640
around.

858
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,200
And I remember that I just a storm to the

859
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,000
booth and it's like like we have a PyLadies

860
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,760
we're doing this.

861
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,880
Oh, and PyLadies Amsterdam is doing

862
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,480
workshops and

863
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,840
if you're gonna put a counter how much time

864
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,320
I mentioned workshops by the anthem EuroPython.

865
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,280
I think everyone does. That's

866
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,560
crazy

867
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,800
lady that's talking about workshops.

868
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:14,640
Oh my God.

869
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,560
I think it's really good to hear your

870
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,520
experience.

871
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,200
As

872
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,280
you know, I'm one of the people who

873
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,960
administer the chapters

874
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,560
for PyLadies is basically whenever someone say

875
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,800
I want to start PyLadies, I'm the one

876
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,600
giving the initial like access, creating

877
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,880
their account and everything.

878
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,960
I think there's a lot of people they want

879
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,840
to start a group, but they don't know how

880
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,400
to or they don't know what it entails.

881
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,480
Maybe, you know, some people think I just

882
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,160
open a meet up account, but there's a lot of,

883
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,280
like you mentioned, like you need to

884
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,560
outreach, you need to ask people to come

885
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,480
and speak, right, giving workshops and

886
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,760
figuring out what's a good format or not.

887
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,640
So I think it will be good to share all of

888
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,960
this experience with people like. Yeah.

889
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,920
You know, if I made to add what's really

890
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,360
interesting, my goal is not to create

891
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,360
workshop givers.

892
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,320
That's not my goal.

893
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,000
My goal is to encourage people to trade out,

894
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,480
realize whether it's hard, not hard, like

895
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,040
it doesn't matter.

896
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,640
But then I was constantly asking myself why

897
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,040
I'm doing this, you know, what's the

898
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,960
purpose of running it for so many years?

899
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,600
Why didn't you know? There was like a lot

900
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,920
of changes in other like organizers.

901
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,120
We also, by the way, we keep our team

902
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,880
really, really small.

903
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,960
So the biggest amount of people we used to

904
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,800
have, it was 3.

905
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,040
That was the biggest amount.

906
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,840
And now like there are again, two of us

907
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:32,680
so far.

908
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,000
So I'm happy to see that our workshop

909
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,040
givers now speaking at the conferences.

910
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,720
And I think that's for me the best.

911
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,600
We, even though they can, for example,

912
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
speak even for local events, I'm already

913
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,360
happy with that.

914
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,680
It gives them confidence that they can, it

915
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,360
gives them confidence that

916
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,720
you can do that.

917
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,000
And you know, there is nothing weird about that.

918
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,120
And to lure people to do that, I'm usually

919
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,800
talking about two options.

920
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,840
I'm saying option number one, you're

921
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,360
working with some specific Python library,

922
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,720
a specific concept you work in every day.

923
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,240
For sure.

924
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,080
There are a lot, like a lot of tricks up on

925
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,640
your sleep sleeps upon your trick, it

926
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,240
doesn't matter.

927
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,120
Butter with butter.

928
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,080
So you probably know something that other

929
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,720
people don't.

930
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:15,920
So just share it.

931
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,440
Like even though if you're working with

932
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,400
pandas, I mean like there are so many

933
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
things that you can do.

934
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,280
Like there are so many like how you handle UTC.

935
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,040
I mean, there are a lot of things and

936
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,560
people do not realize that.

937
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,760
So you're usually saying focus on something

938
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,360
that you're doing every day and just share

939
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,120
what you can share.

940
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,920
Of course, like protecting sensitivity of

941
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,200
the data of the task.

942
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,800
If it's like intellectual property and

943
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,960
everything or your

944
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:38,560
employees

945
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,600
doesn't allow you to share something, fine.

946
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,640
But from the other side, I'm saying maybe

947
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,000
there is something on your bucket list that

948
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,120
you never dare to try and you never had

949
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,840
time for that.

950
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,520
And then if you can tap into that

951
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,640
potential, it's like you can try it and

952
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,960
then you can run it and then you can

953
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,040
upskill people that.

954
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,280
And by the way, if you also have some kind

955
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,400
of, I don't know, like performance or

956
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,280
whatever called stupid plan on your work

957
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,960
and you can also add it there.

958
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,880
So where basically you will be allowed even

959
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,560
to use your working hours for that. So

960
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,280
it's like we win situation for everyone and

961
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,800
somehow it worked so far.

962
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,560
It definitely have been helpful for me as well.

963
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,880
And I I totally agree.

964
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,880
Like even in the beginning, I just

965
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,400
I didn't think public speaking is something

966
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,680
I could ever do.

967
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,160
At least when I first came to one of my

968
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,320
earlier tech conference, one of my first

969
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,320
PyCon like I was really impressed to see a

970
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,680
lot of women speaking.

971
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,160
Before that, another conference I've been

972
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,720
to, it was very commercial.

973
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,160
The speakers are all

974
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,680
CEO or CTO's or something very high up.

975
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,960
I don't see normal people like me speaking

976
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,280
on stage. So I

977
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,800
I just thought that you must be a professor

978
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,880
or CEO to speak at conferences.

979
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,200
But it's not, at least not in the Python

980
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,280
committee and definitely not in the PyLadies

981
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,160
community.

982
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,120
So I do feel it is the purpose of this

983
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,520
community to provide that space and you

984
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,440
should take it.

985
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:06,600
Yeah.

986
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,280
And, and I think you just like, you know,

987
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,520
give away my secrets, just like that's my

988
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,720
motivation of,

989
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,480
you know, I love giving workshop because

990
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,680
like I get it as an opportunity to really

991
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,840
like strengthen what I already know or

992
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,520
maybe I know a little bit, but I want to

993
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,760
know more than after I learned it then

994
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,880
because I know how to explain it to other

995
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,280
people.

996
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:25,880
So it's like,

997
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,720
you know, I think it's a very good like

998
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,920
learning opportunity for whoever is like

999
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,320
giving the workshop as well. Yeah.

1000
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:31,680
Yeah.

1001
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,560
And it's not only this.

1002
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,240
I think what for me is really, really

1003
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:35,920
important.

1004
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,120
I want to recreate your current working

1005
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,040
situation in the room.

1006
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,040
So what do you mean by that? Like at least

1007
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,840
like our chapter, that was our decision

1008
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,560
that we allowing anyone doesn't matter.

1009
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,640
Like whatever, you know, the society, like

1010
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,040
put what type of labels on them.

1011
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,880
So basically, if you're interested in if

1012
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,040
you're working with Python and you're

1013
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,240
interested in this particular topic, join us.

1014
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,280
If not, no, you know,

1015
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,240
really simple.

1016
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,480
But the workshops would be given.

1017
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,880
So we have at least 12 workshops per year.

1018
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,760
So at least 11 workshops would be given

1019
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,480
predominantly by females or transgenders.

1020
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,000
Are there different options that exist

1021
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,520
nowadays? Let's put it this way.

1022
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,600
So like, that's the power.

1023
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,360
And it's really funny to see people when

1024
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,840
you're talking to them and they were like,

1025
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,000
oh, you know, I can give workshop.

1026
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,920
I was like, yes, I do agree you can give a

1027
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,320
workshop.

1028
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,360
We have only one slot for you per year.

1029
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,320
Otherwise, if you don't do any big

1030
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,600
contributions to the community, you

1031
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,200
wouldn't be given this slot.

1032
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,360
So which means you need to pair up with

1033
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,200
your female or other colleagues and let's

1034
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,480
them run the workshop.

1035
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,560
Oh, we don't have senior women, OK,

1036
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,600
even as junior women give her space to to

1037
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,440
run a workshop and just be there.

1038
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,640
Not as somebody who stand in front of her.

1039
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,960
No, as her shadow.

1040
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,760
Like, tried it.

1041
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,560
And I think for me, the funniest part was

1042
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,120
to see in our first workshops where in the

1043
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,720
room were only like, two or three guys and

1044
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,280
one of them, you know, walked toward me.

1045
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,080
It's like, now I do understand.

1046
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,360
How does it feel now? I don't understand.

1047
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,680
I've never, ever been in room with such a

1048
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,840
big amount of, like, female engineers.

1049
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,480
So what I meant by saying before that I

1050
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,760
want to recreate

1051
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,560
what you're going to see in the workplace.

1052
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,480
That's why we are open for everyone.

1053
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,480
So usually if you look at our workshops,

1054
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,640
it's really mixed.

1055
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,560
It's always mixed.

1056
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,640
So the guys there is like the females and

1057
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,720
other and I really enjoy it because what I

1058
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,000
didn't liked for with a lot of female

1059
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,040
communities, they keep you in a bubble,

1060
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,200
they keep you in a bubble.

1061
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,920
Sisterhood supports everything, but it's

1062
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,360
not real life.

1063
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,560
I just want to prep you for the real life.

1064
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,520
Yes, it would be not easy, but at least you

1065
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,480
know how to find your sponsors, you know

1066
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,040
how to find your allies, you know, like how

1067
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,080
to build your career up, how to manage up

1068
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,120
people if you're gonna work with different

1069
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,520
people.

1070
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,160
And I had some experience like with the

1071
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,760
pure female communities, which I really

1072
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,760
didn't like.

1073
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,360
And that's the reason why I said I'm

1074
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,720
creating an inclusive community with some,

1075
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
you know, with some they'd say remarks.

1076
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,240
With some adjustments.

1077
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,120
Yes,

1078
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,120
yes, yes.

1079
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,680
I still think that I do agree with you, but

1080
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,720
I think that, you know, there are different

1081
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,240
purpose of this kind of

1082
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
kind of focus group.

1083
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,440
I think one of them is

1084
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,280
like what you said, I think it's beautiful,

1085
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,560
but I think if someone want to have a more

1086
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,320
kind of, you know, support network, that's

1087
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,120
also OK too.

1088
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,120
But remember like maybe you should form

1089
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,440
this group to join the majority group so

1090
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,760
you can integrate as well.

1091
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,800
I think the only part which we usually do

1092
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,600
not cover.

1093
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,120
So we usually do not cover something for

1094
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,120
complete beginners.

1095
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,840
We did some events in the past, but then we

1096
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,280
switch fully to more, let's say mature folks.

1097
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,800
So in this case, if they are complete

1098
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,440
beginner, we

1099
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,240
sends

1100
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,160
folks to the

1101
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,440
other communities that exist that are more

1102
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,480
and more, let's say better suitable for

1103
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,280
complete beginners.

1104
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,680
If you just start working, for example,

1105
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,440
with any programming languages, Python is

1106
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,320
your first or if you switch it from another

1107
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,040
one to Python

1108
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,160
or vice versa.

1109
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,120
So in this case we do redirect them to

1110
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,680
other places where they can find

1111
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,560
information because like for beginners

1112
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,120
there is a lot of.

1113
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,360
Things you can send people to us humble

1114
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,080
data because we are absolute beginner focus.

1115
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:04,840
We do.

1116
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,840
We also going to do this for Pydata

1117
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,560
Amsterdam by the way, this year.

1118
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,680
Yeah, nice. So.

1119
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,600
This is going to happen as well, yes, but

1120
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,480
that's our focus.

1121
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,600
I usually say it's like, you know,

1122
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
community by practitioners for

1123
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,560
practitioners or for practitioners by

1124
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,200
practitioners.

1125
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,720
I think that's good.

1126
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,240
I think that's good that you found what

1127
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,800
kind of status that meet up is like, what

1128
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,560
purpose it is, what benefit it can give to

1129
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,280
the members.

1130
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,280
I think it's beautiful.

1131
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,840
No, I think that's actually important for

1132
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,600
you to define what you want out of your

1133
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,240
community.

1134
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,360
Like you can't just be doing everything

1135
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,840
just for the sake of doing it.

1136
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,360
You need to have a efficient

1137
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,680
priorities.

1138
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,160
Yeah.

1139
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,640
Do you have anything that you really want

1140
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,480
to talk about that we didn't cover? We can

1141
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:44,920
do that.

1142
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,200
I think yes, one topic that I really want

1143
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,560
to touch upon, there's like the

1144
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,240
recruitments.

1145
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,960
I just want to add something involved.

1146
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,680
OK, please. Yeah,

1147
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,120
the first, first thing first, like I

1148
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,760
finally got I I signed an offer today, so

1149
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,800
that's finally.

1150
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,960
Oh, congratulations journey.

1151
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,160
Yeah, that was a long, a long, a long, long

1152
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,800
journey. Yeah. So.

1153
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,560
That's about it, yeah.

1154
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,960
One thing that I want to point out and

1155
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,880
that's where things gets really, really

1156
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,240
weird is when you're looking for a very top

1157
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,400
level positions and that's where the rubber

1158
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,240
hits the ground.

1159
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,640
So before that I was privileged not to,

1160
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,000
let's say looking for a job.

1161
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,680
The jobs were looking for me.

1162
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,680
So I was usually, you know, they were that,

1163
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,320
yeah, it doesn't matter like what I was

1164
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,960
doing whether it was my company or not my

1165
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,640
company somehow I like organize space

1166
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,400
around me in such a way that people start

1167
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:33,840
reaching out.

1168
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,720
So that was my reality for I would say the

1169
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,640
last 20 years.

1170
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,320
So I again, I was privileged to, you know,

1171
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,200
to, to build that.

1172
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,720
And when people are saying, oh, you know,

1173
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,680
now around the layoffs and everything, I

1174
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,400
was like, thankfully never hit by layoff.

1175
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,720
I have never experienced it because I was

1176
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,200
always feeling that something is going on.

1177
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,640
So I was usually switching gears before the

1178
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,680
layoffs were happening.

1179
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,600
Just say that's just like my I don't know what.

1180
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,520
Call it sex sense or stupid sense.

1181
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,400
Instinct.

1182
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,160
Yeah,

1183
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,960
so I had some personal changes.

1184
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,000
That's the reason behind like the selling

1185
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,520
house and everything. And

1186
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,000
apparently

1187
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,640
I was working for myself and I went to chat

1188
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,440
with my bank.

1189
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,120
So I will need the mortgage for like parts

1190
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,720
of the sum.

1191
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,040
So like can I get it and whatever like or

1192
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,800
can I move the mortgage that I have in the

1193
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,040
house to that? Like it's, they call it like

1194
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,160
over brewing, which means like over

1195
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,760
bridging, which I really like.

1196
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,240
Like the whole term basically idea was if

1197
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,360
you're working, if you're working for

1198
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,640
yourself in the Netherlands is possible,

1199
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,280
but you would not be given a mortgage

1200
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,600
unless you have three years of operations.

1201
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,840
And with my company, latest company, only

1202
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,000
one year of operations, which means that I

1203
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,840
need to return to the workforce.

1204
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,760
So basically I need to get to work for

1205
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,920
someone else because like if you want to

1206
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,560
get a mortgage, if I want to leave And the

1207
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,840
reason like why I'm given when want to take

1208
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,320
a mortgage, why just not to rent.

1209
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,480
The prices of taking a mortgage is 2 times

1210
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,200
lower versus renting.

1211
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,800
And that's the difference and the market is crazy.

1212
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,200
Of course I can go to smaller village,

1213
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,160
leave Amsterdam.

1214
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,120
It's always the case.

1215
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,000
The problem is in the smaller village,

1216
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,680
there would be the same price, but you I

1217
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,680
get more square meters.

1218
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,920
I don't need more square meters.

1219
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,640
That's the thing.

1220
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,560
So getting back, sorry, staying on track.

1221
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,760
I have to find a job basically like I have

1222
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,800
to work for someone else.

1223
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,560
I have to get a permanent contract or like

1224
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,880
a temporary contract with some things next

1225
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,640
to it to get a mortgage or to extend my

1226
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,160
mortgage.

1227
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,040
So I started my search.

1228
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,360
It was in May.

1229
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,480
I started my search in May.

1230
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,480
So I was really, you know, like I'm OK,

1231
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,760
I'm, I'm going to read descriptions.

1232
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,720
We're going to see what's there.

1233
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,640
So the positions I was heading for were

1234
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,400
like head of director of artificial

1235
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,000
intelligence.

1236
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,480
So I was applying for different companies. So I

1237
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,560
like choose three.

1238
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,440
I was really, you know, like picking out

1239
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,000
what I where I want to apply.

1240
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,680
I, I applied there and guess what, nothing

1241
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,880
like completely nothing.

1242
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,440
I was like, hmm,

1243
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,440
OK, maybe, you know, if we assume that a

1244
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,040
lot of recruiters and the enterprises using

1245
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,520
AI tools now, then let's use AI again to,

1246
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,360
to, to apply.

1247
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,640
So I generated a batch of things tailored

1248
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,800
periche use case, whatever, I send it

1249
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,560
nothing.

1250
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,720
And I was like, what I'm doing wrong? I'm

1251
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,440
already like, there are two weeks in the

1252
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,080
process and now thing comes out like how

1253
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,920
it's even possible.

1254
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,840
And then one smart person told me, you

1255
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,880
know, just take a batch and do batch a

1256
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,000
plane literally.

1257
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,000
Of course you can go, we are like false,

1258
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,640
you know, who can refer you and blah, blah, blah.

1259
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,480
But do batch because in case start like

1260
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,800
treat it as a funnel and then, you know, as

1261
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,240
you go, go, go pick up.

1262
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,640
And I was like, yeah, but it's not what I

1263
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,120
wanted.

1264
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,760
That's not what I want to do Just go.

1265
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,880
So I created one batch dictated the

1266
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,560
position of this like director, head of

1267
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,400
artificial intelligence, and I created the

1268
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,480
second batch for

1269
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,120
staff engineer or yeah, staff an engineer

1270
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,800
or principal engineer or something like that.

1271
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,720
And I start applying.

1272
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,360
So here start distraction.

1273
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,800
And the finest part was the first screening calls.

1274
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,480
The screen calls were like the first

1275
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,240
question in the Netherlands is what's your

1276
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,560
salary expectations? They usually said like

1277
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,800
put your salary expectations in the form,

1278
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,160
even in the recruitment form.

1279
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,680
That's where I were testing their

1280
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,400
front end and back end

1281
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,840
by putting minus 100, 5.

1282
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,160
You know,

1283
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,040
like everything.

1284
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,000
Like let's,

1285
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:08,560
let's.

1286
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,080
Let's try how it works.

1287
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,040
So the funniest part is I'm usually try to

1288
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,440
jump in front of this question from

1289
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,440
recruiter because usually the first was

1290
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,720
this question gets the better question in

1291
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,400
position at least at the Dutch market.

1292
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,840
Let's put in this way, although it was

1293
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,800
applying for a lot of EMEA remote

1294
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,320
positions.

1295
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,440
So I was like, OK,

1296
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,400
let's do that.

1297
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,680
And I usually starting OK, So what is the

1298
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,040
expected salary range like I'm asking

1299
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,640
specifically for range because it gives

1300
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,520
them freedom, you know, to go from where

1301
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,040
and just to show me the boundaries.

1302
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,240
So then we can discuss later like how it's

1303
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:40,720
gonna work.

1304
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,720
The funniest part is there was a lot of

1305
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,840
really top level positions with salary

1306
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,160
which were below like even like senior

1307
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,240
engineer positions.

1308
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,400
And I was like, I'm sorry, like with this

1309
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,320
responsibility, like why? And then

1310
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,400
you get really weird questions.

1311
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,320
There's like, why do you need so much money?

1312
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:01,800
Why not?

1313
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,440
I I would, I would try to answer the

1314
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:04,840
question.

1315
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,800
It's like I want to donate to the Python

1316
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,720
community.

1317
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,880
That's why I need money.

1318
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,320
Come on.

1319
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,120
Like, yes,

1320
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,880
maybe, maybe that's a good question.

1321
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,720
Like good answer.

1322
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,040
I don't know.

1323
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,880
Like that's

1324
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,760
that's the reason people work to get money,

1325
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:19,800
Jesus and.

1326
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,320
I was like,

1327
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,600
oh, you know,

1328
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,440
you know, And it's like you're working free

1329
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,200
of charge.

1330
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,360
It's like, no, it's like,

1331
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,320
strange.

1332
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,360
Why I shouldn't work?

1333
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,360
Yeah.

1334
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,080
Yeah, they pay you by Bitcoin, No.

1335
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,600
By beautiful eyes,

1336
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,160
Yeah. Yeah.

1337
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,360
So like, but to cut the monster short, I

1338
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,720
ended up like the end of the final was for

1339
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,400
companies.

1340
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,120
And then I did another twist.

1341
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,640
When I was in the process of these

1342
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,880
companies, I was telling them directly that

1343
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,760
you are not the only one.

1344
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,280
So, you know, we can play see the game and

1345
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,840
said, yes, of course, you're the only one

1346
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,080
company I ever ever dreamed to work for. Sure.

1347
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:55,760
Fine. Right.

1348
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,880
So I was telling them and it's really

1349
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,320
interesting to see the reaction.

1350
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,280
Some of them were like,

1351
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,080
you know, it's not good that you're saying that.

1352
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,320
I was like, yeah, I know it's not good.

1353
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,080
But because we are on the final stages, I

1354
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,840
want to be clear.

1355
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,800
That's like I expected

1356
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,680
offers coming in and I'm gonna

1357
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,800
surprise, surprise.

1358
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,840
I'm gonna compare the offers, surprise,

1359
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,280
surprise.

1360
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,440
And I'm gonna ask what I want, you know? So

1361
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,200
that's the thing.

1362
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,200
Company are expecting people to be like

1363
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,280
lying on Tinder right? Like I only have eye

1364
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:21,720
on you.

1365
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,680
Like, no, that's

1366
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,440
of course

1367
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,200
people are swiping on the time, right? Like it's

1368
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:30,840
just so funny.

1369
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:31,680
Sorry,

1370
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:32,760
continue.

1371
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,600
But then you know, the funniest parts.

1372
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,440
So the week

1373
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,760
one of the companies they were

1374
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,760
there was some like holidays and they

1375
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,320
basically like they dropped the ball.

1376
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,000
So I didn't hear anything from them like

1377
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,760
for three weeks.

1378
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,160
Now they came back to me like, oh, let's

1379
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,120
schedule an interview.

1380
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,160
And I was like, OK, let's schedule.

1381
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,040
And then I was like, oh, sorry, like please

1382
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,240
cancel the interview because I already like

1383
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,240
already have offers.

1384
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,880
Although it's a final interview, but it's

1385
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,000
like an interview with C level folks.

1386
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,920
I don't want to rob their of their time.

1387
00:42:58,920 --> 00:42:59,680
You know that's.

1388
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,040
That's it.

1389
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:00,640
Beat them all.

1390
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,200
I'm sorry.

1391
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:01,960
No. Yeah.

1392
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,840
And then the question would be, you know,

1393
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,560
when they're gonna look how we lost this

1394
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,720
candidate at the ends they they would be,

1395
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,440
oh, we lost this candidate because of

1396
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,160
competition.

1397
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,800
No, you didn't lose this candidate because

1398
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,560
of competition.

1399
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,520
You lost this person because you were not

1400
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,000
responsive for three weeks.

1401
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,400
And like, I need to eat.

1402
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,960
Sorry, the girls gotta eat, you know?

1403
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,040
Yeah,

1404
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,520
very interesting.

1405
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,480
I felt the culture of hiring is somewhat

1406
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,080
different.

1407
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,160
I'm in the North America and like we, I, we

1408
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,400
went through the same thing.

1409
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,040
When I apply for a job,

1410
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,200
I have to apply for like 10 different

1411
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,080
companies and maybe I get interviewed for

1412
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,200
one or two, right? And it's the same thing,

1413
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,440
but something's different is like, I mean,

1414
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,320
it's definitely OK for me to say, yeah, I

1415
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,520
they will ask am I interviewing for other

1416
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,600
companies? Like I will say yes,

1417
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,280
like especially if you, when you say you're

1418
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,360
hiring, you're interviewing for higher

1419
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,600
level position.

1420
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,280
That means you know you have lots of skill, but

1421
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,800
you you can a lot of people want your skill.

1422
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,880
You can ask them, like, are you only

1423
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
considering one candidate? No.

1424
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,240
So yeah,

1425
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,320
why not? It's like, you know, give and

1426
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:07,880
take, right?

1427
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,000
Yeah, it's both ways.

1428
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,040
It's both ways.

1429
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:10,560
Yeah.

1430
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,120
So yeah,

1431
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,160
that's basically what I wanted to share.

1432
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,720
For me, it was really surprise.

1433
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,720
First, it was like a lot of questions like

1434
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,920
why do you need the salary? Like why do I

1435
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,600
need a salary?

1436
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:20,520
Come on.

1437
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,200
You, you can try asking kindergarten's

1438
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,040
children and they would also give you a

1439
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,560
very reasonable answer. You. Yeah,

1440
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:28,520
I mean.

1441
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:28,920
Yeah,

1442
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:29,480
yeah.

1443
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,040
And the second one is like when you're like

1444
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,840
get into the talk, like when you get into

1445
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,520
the ends.

1446
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,280
They usually also like the, the, the

1447
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,600
recruitment process is not very clear.

1448
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,000
I'm usually asking about the structure.

1449
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,480
And usually they don't have a proper

1450
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,800
structure for such positions.

1451
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,200
It goes like, oh, we're gonna have three

1452
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:42,920
interviews and that's it.

1453
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,120
And then you ended up having nine

1454
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:44,720
interviews.

1455
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,640
That's the story is.

1456

00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,080

You have

1461
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,600

can have a job.

1472
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,480

00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,120
inspire a lot of.

1474
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,560

00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,840
Indonesian

1477
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,200
movie home sweet loan.

1478
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,680
It's like also a journey

1479
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,680
of a woman like she wants to be independent

1480
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,680
from her family.

1481
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,160
She wants to have a piece for herself, a

1482
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,040

1483

by like she wants to work and

1484
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:40,480
in order to

1485
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,960
qualify for mortgage.

1486
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,440
