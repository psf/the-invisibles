Hi everybody, welcome to PyPodcats

2
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.814
Hidden Figures of Python podcast series.

3
00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:29.422
The PyPodcats is created to

4
00:00:29.422 --> 00:00:32.014
highlight voices from the underrepresented group

5
00:00:32.014 --> 00:00:34.422
group members of the Python community.

6
00:00:34.422 --> 00:00:36.726
We follow the Python Software

7
00:00:36.726 --> 00:00:38.654
Foundation's Code of Conduct.

8
00:00:38.654 --> 00:00:41.142
So if you want to know a little bit more about

9
00:00:41.142 --> 00:00:46.814
the Code of Conduct, you can check on pypodcats.live/conduct

10
00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:52.230
That's pypodcats.live/conduct

11
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.678
Let me do a little bit of a self introduction.

12
00:00:54.678 --> 00:00:58.070
My name is Georgi and I'm based in Amsterdam.

13
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.014
I'm one of the PyPodcats hosts and I'm

14
00:01:01.014 --> 00:01:03.918
also one of the board director from the PSF.

15
00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:05.558
Over to you, Tereza.

16
00:01:05.558 --> 00:01:08.718
Hi, my name is Tereza, I'm based in Hamburg.

17
00:01:08.718 --> 00:01:10.550
I'm also one of the PyPodcats.

18
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.942
I'm involved in several initiatives of Python Software

19
00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:17.622
Foundation, like the Code of Conduct Work Group

20
00:01:17.622 --> 00:01:21.030
Diversity and Inclusion workgroup, and PyLadies Hamburg.

21
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.694
And on to you, Vicky, our guest for this episode.

22
00:01:25.694 --> 00:01:27.262
Hi everyone, Vicky here.

23
00:01:27.262 --> 00:01:29.022
I'm based in Dublin, Ireland.

24
00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:31.726
I look after PyLadies Dublin here, and I

25
00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:34.374
have many, many hats on which we'll name,

26
00:01:34.374 --> 00:01:37.350
but I am helping out in the PSF

27
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.510
Grants Working group as well, amongst other things.

28
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.430
So thank you for having me here today

29
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.206
And thank you, Vicky, for joining.

30
00:01:45.206 --> 00:01:48.006
Well, Vicky, you have been an active member

31
00:01:48.006 --> 00:01:50.630
in the Python community for quite some time.

32
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.502
So how do you get started using the Python language?

33
00:01:54.502 --> 00:02:01.974
That was back in around 2002 when my now husband

34
00:02:01.974 --> 00:02:04.806
then we used to work together in the company.

35
00:02:04.806 --> 00:02:06.302
He came across Python and we decided

36
00:02:06.302 --> 00:02:08.973
to use it to help streamline, streamline

37
00:02:08.973 --> 00:02:12.686
our internal tools, processes made our life really easy,

38
00:02:12.686 --> 00:02:15.694
as devs are kind of lazy and stuff.

39
00:02:15.694 --> 00:02:18.670
So this really helped us out a lot. And it was out.

40
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.702
It was just really nice and simple to use.

41
00:02:20.702 --> 00:02:23.694
And it was actually days before we encountered Python,

42
00:02:23.694 --> 00:02:26.006
I did a Perl course at work and had the cert.

43
00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:27.286
I was just sitting there lying on

44
00:02:27.286 --> 00:02:29.526
the table, forgotten once I discovered Python.

45
00:02:29.526 --> 00:02:33.006
So that's how I started using Python quite early on.

46
00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:34.750
And it was just really helped

47
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.566
us out, really improved things.

48
00:02:36.566 --> 00:02:39.726
I was helped with a lot of projects, especially with

49
00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:42.318
the management and things like that, which is great to

50
00:02:42.318 --> 00:02:45.062
see that even current day, I see my old colleagues

51
00:02:45.062 --> 00:02:47.350
still using Python and things like that.

52
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.206
I assume they improved on the tools, but

53
00:02:49.206 --> 00:02:51.230
it was good to be super early and

54
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.350
just making life easy for everyone, using a

55
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.830
super amazing technology and super easy to use.

56
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.230
That's really cool.

57
00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.894
I have a question, though, regarding

58
00:02:59.894 --> 00:03:01.942
your involvement in the Python community.

59
00:03:01.942 --> 00:03:04.894
What attracted you to the community itself, like

60
00:03:04.894 --> 00:03:09.074
organizing events and getting into PyLadies, for example?

61
00:03:09.074 --> 00:03:10.874
You're not just coding in Python,

62
00:03:10.874 --> 00:03:12.514
but you're doing so much more.

63
00:03:12.514 --> 00:03:15.170
I suppose back in those days before Meetup and

64
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.570
Eventbrite came around, you have to know in Ireland

65
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.498
we may have one meetup a year. And that's true.

66
00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:21.250
The irish Linux user group mailing list, if

67
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.570
you are honest and primarily word of mouth.

68
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.186
As much as I love my work colleagues at

69
00:03:25.186 --> 00:03:28.026
the time, I do want to learn from other

70
00:03:28.026 --> 00:03:30.602
people, like my peers, from other companies as well,

71
00:03:30.602 --> 00:03:32.690
and other technology, which I just want my brain

72
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.814
to be melted a little bit and don't understand.

73
00:03:35.434 --> 00:03:39.082
So when Python came about, probably two years after

74
00:03:39.082 --> 00:03:41.178
we discovered Python and we saw other people who

75
00:03:41.178 --> 00:03:43.026
were doing toys and stuff, and in Dublin, I

76
00:03:43.026 --> 00:03:44.170
saw the meetup, jumped on it.

77
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.514
That was about 2004.

78
00:03:45.514 --> 00:03:47.522
It was started by an engineer called

79
00:03:47.522 --> 00:03:49.218
Darragh Sherwin, and then it got rebooted

80
00:03:49.218 --> 00:03:51.730
in 2005 by the amazing Sean O'Donnell.

81
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.202
And we were gathered around a dark pub. Irish pub.

82
00:03:55.202 --> 00:03:56.954
Yes, we're in Ireland. Stereotype.

83
00:03:56.954 --> 00:03:57.866
We all meet in the pub.

84
00:03:57.866 --> 00:03:58.842
Yes, that's what we do.

85
00:03:58.842 --> 00:04:00.378
Sit around this tiny laptop in

86
00:04:00.378 --> 00:04:01.970
the dark pub just not working.

87
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.442
And someone said, let's get a room

88
00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:05.266
with a projector and give talks.

89
00:04:05.266 --> 00:04:06.804
And no one volunteered.

90
00:04:06.804 --> 00:04:08.476
So I said, oh, how hard could it be?

91
00:04:08.476 --> 00:04:11.324
So I took the ball and ran with it and

92
00:04:11.324 --> 00:04:14.388
ran the Python Ireland meetups every month, nearly every month

93
00:04:14.388 --> 00:04:17.531
for nearly over eleven years before I handed it over.

94
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:18.868
So that's how I got involved

95
00:04:18.868 --> 00:04:20.692
with the Python Ireland community.

96
00:04:20.692 --> 00:04:22.580
It was pretty much very early on, and

97
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.556
when everything was extremely exciting, completely new technology,

98
00:04:25.556 --> 00:04:27.636
that was the hottest thing right then, and

99
00:04:27.636 --> 00:04:29.340
everyone just wanted to share what they did

100
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.484
with Python and its related technologies. With PyLadies,

101
00:04:32.484 --> 00:04:35.724
that's another, another story as well that got

102
00:04:35.724 --> 00:04:39.932
launched during PyCon Ireland in 2013 as well.

103
00:04:39.932 --> 00:04:42.060
So, yeah, a lot of things kind of started

104
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.824
by me, I think a serial starter of things.

105
00:04:46.844 --> 00:04:48.172
So when was that?

106
00:04:48.172 --> 00:04:50.260
Is that in like a year?

107
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.284
It was.

108
00:04:51.284 --> 00:04:54.724
So PyLadies Dublin was launched in 2013.

109
00:04:54.724 --> 00:04:59.224
So that was my last year chairing PyCon Ireland 2013.

110
00:05:00.164 --> 00:05:02.796
It was a pivotal moment because I managed to

111
00:05:02.796 --> 00:05:06.300
invite a very first female keynote technical speaker, and

112
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.500
that was Lynn Root, and she was co founder

113
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.788
of the San Francisco chapter of PyLadies.

114
00:05:10.788 --> 00:05:12.340
And I go, it's a sign.

115
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.148
Why not launch PyLadies Dublin?

116
00:05:14.148 --> 00:05:16.348
I was launching not for profit initiatives all

117
00:05:16.348 --> 00:05:17.820
over the place around 2012 and 13.

118
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.724
I said, what's one more to add to the list?

119
00:05:20.724 --> 00:05:24.068
So we launched it in 2013 during sprints weekend, and

120
00:05:24.068 --> 00:05:27.132
we had about six-ish people, a nice yummy cake

121
00:05:27.132 --> 00:05:29.100
and a plan that we don't want to be the

122
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.460
same as other technical user groups at the time, which

123
00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.940
we know is mainly two long talks with beer and

124
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.292
pizza in the middle, and then the pub afterwards.

125
00:05:37.292 --> 00:05:40.284
And I did say we go to pub meetups a lot here,

126
00:05:40.284 --> 00:05:43.900
especially in Ireland, but the folks here did not want to go

127
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.020
to pubs, did not want pizza and beer all the time.

128
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.020
They wanted something more interactive, but

129
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.644
they do want something monthly.

130
00:05:50.644 --> 00:05:55.316
And, I mean, I'm still doing it right now, and it's currently

131
00:05:55.316 --> 00:05:58.020
trying to keep it small to try and make sure that it's

132
00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.316
not too scary for someone who's new coming into the group and

133
00:06:01.316 --> 00:06:03.572
who wants to speak up or want to give a talk, or

134
00:06:03.572 --> 00:06:06.940
just want to go around and meet other people and just don't

135
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.028
feel like they want to run away.

136
00:06:08.028 --> 00:06:10.588
And because I'm not a coder or I'm not this, I'm

137
00:06:10.588 --> 00:06:12.380
not a Python person, just want to make sure you just

138
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.620
come along, you're curious, or you just want to share and

139
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.644
be excited about something you found in Python.

140
00:06:16.644 --> 00:06:17.892
Just share with us.

141
00:06:17.892 --> 00:06:19.104
It's a safe space.

142
00:06:19.804 --> 00:06:22.764
So that's 2013, quite a while ago.

143
00:06:22.764 --> 00:06:25.004
I'd like to add a question, a follow up question.

144
00:06:25.004 --> 00:06:26.436
Maybe it's a bit off script.

145
00:06:26.436 --> 00:06:30.996
Okay, so how has your involvement in

146
00:06:30.996 --> 00:06:33.084
the Python community helped in your career,

147
00:06:33.084 --> 00:06:34.868
or has it helped in your career?

148
00:06:34.868 --> 00:06:36.236
Helping, yes.

149
00:06:36.236 --> 00:06:39.362
And I'm so blessed to have come across the Python

150
00:06:39.362 --> 00:06:43.474
community, especially, as I said, I was really very privileged

151
00:06:43.474 --> 00:06:45.018
in the right place at the right time, being able

152
00:06:45.018 --> 00:06:47.554
to see Python in the early days, being able to

153
00:06:47.554 --> 00:06:50.098
see a lot of the core developers, especially when I've

154
00:06:50.098 --> 00:06:52.018
gone to EuroPython and I actually came across them.

155
00:06:52.018 --> 00:06:53.914
I didn't even know they were the core developers.

156
00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:55.290
And then I kind of nearly fainted when

157
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.666
my husband told me, you were sitting on

158
00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:58.482
the table with all the core developers.

159
00:06:58.482 --> 00:07:01.546
But they were so welcoming and so inviting and

160
00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:03.666
so amazing to talk to and so supportive.

161
00:07:03.666 --> 00:07:07.250
Those early days in 2009, while we're trying to

162
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.722
prepare our first conference in 2010 for PyCon Ireland,

163
00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:12.894
it was the support of John Pinner and everyone

164
00:07:13.474 --> 00:07:15.938
that helped us through, you know, setting up, like,

165
00:07:15.938 --> 00:07:17.578
thinking of the ethos and why you're setting up

166
00:07:17.578 --> 00:07:20.074
the conference, who you're setting it up for.

167
00:07:20.074 --> 00:07:23.322
I think meeting those people and being supportive gave

168
00:07:23.322 --> 00:07:25.922
me the kind of positivity that I want to

169
00:07:25.922 --> 00:07:27.602
pay forward and help others as well.

170
00:07:27.602 --> 00:07:29.642
And that's why I carry that as I left Python

171
00:07:29.642 --> 00:07:33.146
Ireland behind and PyCon Ireland behind, because other people have

172
00:07:33.146 --> 00:07:35.002
to take over, and I was burning out, but I

173
00:07:35.002 --> 00:07:37.434
still want to carry on PyLadies Dublin, and I just

174
00:07:37.434 --> 00:07:40.790
love how just even Global PyLadies, how we still have

175
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.246
that ethos of trying to help each other, trying to

176
00:07:43.246 --> 00:07:45.662
be inclusive and have safe spaces and stuff.

177
00:07:45.662 --> 00:07:48.350
And that goes same with EuroPython as well.

178
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.222
And that is a huge scale.

179
00:07:50.222 --> 00:07:52.190
But I end up joining a lot of those just to

180
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.838
figure out how things work and run in the background to

181
00:07:54.838 --> 00:07:57.446
try and improve how I do things here in Ireland and

182
00:07:57.446 --> 00:08:00.638
also share that experience with other tech community organizers.

183
00:08:00.638 --> 00:08:02.398
So from a community side of things,

184
00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:03.678
I have learned a lot as a

185
00:08:03.678 --> 00:08:07.374
volunteer, running events, hosting events, organizing events.

186
00:08:07.374 --> 00:08:09.462
Career wise, I kind of stepped back a lot from

187
00:08:09.462 --> 00:08:11.878
being a developer, as I got more pulled into the

188
00:08:11.878 --> 00:08:14.734
community side, even though it's all mostly volunteer.

189
00:08:14.734 --> 00:08:17.790
But I ended up working with say like

190
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.318
Dog Patch Labs, a co-sharing space, who also

191
00:08:21.318 --> 00:08:24.038
runs a startup program here currently.

192
00:08:24.038 --> 00:08:26.830
But they have a space for events and they were launching

193
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.486
it at the time and they asked me to come in

194
00:08:28.486 --> 00:08:31.846
and connect them to the technical user groups around Dublin to

195
00:08:31.846 --> 00:08:33.038
tell them to come along and use this.

196
00:08:33.038 --> 00:08:35.990
So I was pretty much like a liaison with the irish tech

197
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.942
scene and I was trying to keep a finger on the pulse.

198
00:08:38.942 --> 00:08:42.354
There is a very active kind of tech community here.

199
00:08:42.354 --> 00:08:45.482
So Python, I think, formed the basis from that

200
00:08:45.482 --> 00:08:47.242
where I started to meet a lot of different

201
00:08:47.242 --> 00:08:49.642
people because the meetup scene was so small and

202
00:08:49.642 --> 00:08:51.850
everyone start branching off and created their own niche

203
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.634
groups not technically Python related, go to

204
00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:58.186
games, to different language user groups.

205
00:08:58.186 --> 00:09:01.530
From that I bounced from different very kind

206
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:05.146
of interesting roles, like a game and curator

207
00:09:05.146 --> 00:09:08.544
researcher for Dublin science gallery.

208
00:09:08.544 --> 00:09:11.264
Back in 2012, around that same period that was,

209
00:09:11.264 --> 00:09:13.880
I got paid to play games, research about games,

210
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.912
go to games, festivals and things like that.

211
00:09:15.912 --> 00:09:16.824
And they came.

212
00:09:16.824 --> 00:09:19.192
I interviewed a lot of game exhibitors, or

213
00:09:19.192 --> 00:09:22.584
potential exhibitors who became exhibitors, and the gallery

214
00:09:22.584 --> 00:09:25.984
produced an amazing wonder world of an exhibition

215
00:09:25.984 --> 00:09:28.408
from my black and white spreadsheet.

216
00:09:28.408 --> 00:09:30.064
It was fantastic.

217
00:09:30.064 --> 00:09:33.430
That was completely so far away from coding, but

218
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.926
related to games, related to tech connected me to

219
00:09:35.926 --> 00:09:37.742
a lot of indies, and that's where I got

220
00:09:37.742 --> 00:09:39.022
involved with a lot of indies.

221
00:09:39.022 --> 00:09:42.398
So I kind of very spread out in a lot of geeky things.

222
00:09:42.398 --> 00:09:44.382
So community meant a lot to me.

223
00:09:44.382 --> 00:09:46.830
So even though I start moving away from

224
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.702
python stuff, I always think back to how

225
00:09:49.702 --> 00:09:51.902
I got started, and that is Python.

226
00:09:51.902 --> 00:09:54.918
The community itself, the warm heartedness and the open

227
00:09:54.918 --> 00:09:57.198
arms of the community that brought me in in

228
00:09:57.198 --> 00:09:58.950
those early days and showed me the ropes.

229
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.462
And I want to push, give that to everyone else

230
00:10:01.462 --> 00:10:03.198
because it is hard to start off for a lot

231
00:10:03.198 --> 00:10:05.990
of people, it is hard if you fall down, especially

232
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.758
COVID, and you need to restart again.

233
00:10:07.758 --> 00:10:08.638
You need that boost.

234
00:10:08.638 --> 00:10:11.806
And I want to help everyone as much as I could. Right.

235
00:10:11.806 --> 00:10:15.350
I think you're not the first invited guest

236
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.638
that said how important the community has actually

237
00:10:18.638 --> 00:10:21.902
led us into the group and how it

238
00:10:21.902 --> 00:10:26.342
actually motivates us into, like, creating more events,

239
00:10:26.342 --> 00:10:31.054
creating more opportunities for everyone to join.

240
00:10:31.054 --> 00:10:35.734
Your story about how you started PyLadies in Dublin actually

241
00:10:35.734 --> 00:10:39.646
reminds me of how I started, because I was already

242
00:10:39.646 --> 00:10:44.158
in PyCon Thailand, and organizing the event, and one of

243
00:10:44.158 --> 00:10:49.558
the speakers was Lena from PyLadies Japan, Tokyo.

244
00:10:49.558 --> 00:10:51.830
And she gave a talk about PyLadies, and I was

245
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.926
like, hey, wait a minute, there isn't one in Bangkok.

246
00:10:54.926 --> 00:10:56.774
And that was how I actually started

247
00:10:56.774 --> 00:11:00.102
PyLadies Bangkok, along with another co founder.

248
00:11:00.102 --> 00:11:02.438
So I think a lot of us just kind of like a

249
00:11:02.438 --> 00:11:06.684
kind of chain effect that we actually link from one to another.

250
00:11:06.684 --> 00:11:08.740
And I also like the way you

251
00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:13.444
mentioned about how you started PyCon Ireland.

252
00:11:13.444 --> 00:11:16.540
It was a core group of us in the beginning.

253
00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:18.868
There's only like six to maybe

254
00:11:18.868 --> 00:11:20.868
twelve back before Pycon Ireland

255
00:11:20.868 --> 00:11:22.684
was like, you have to know that our

256
00:11:22.684 --> 00:11:25.308
largest ever meetup was, like, 20 people.

257
00:11:25.308 --> 00:11:27.636
You know, this is really small,

258
00:11:27.636 --> 00:11:30.316
but it was enthusiastic, 20 people.

259
00:11:30.316 --> 00:11:31.332
But then when we had our first

260
00:11:31.332 --> 00:11:33.740
PyCon Ireland, it was nearly 100.

261
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.268
And we go, where were the rest of you?

262
00:11:35.268 --> 00:11:37.172
And we're asking for people to come and talk.

263
00:11:37.172 --> 00:11:39.772
That was boiling down to us wanting

264
00:11:39.772 --> 00:11:42.452
to get more experience, because it was.

265
00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:45.132
I pointed to PyCon UK and John Pinner.

266
00:11:45.132 --> 00:11:46.164
It was because they were

267
00:11:46.164 --> 00:11:48.052
It was them who were actually calling out

268
00:11:48.052 --> 00:11:50.940
for the next host for EuroPython in 2010. For 2010.

269
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.804
And the core bunch of us would just so happen

270
00:11:52.804 --> 00:11:55.220
to be in EuroPython in Birmingham the year before, when

271
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.444
they were doing a call for city to host.

272
00:11:57.444 --> 00:11:58.844
And that's how it started, really.

273
00:11:58.844 --> 00:12:00.860
The ball got started there, and then, of

274
00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.524
course, a pub got in there as well.

275
00:12:02.524 --> 00:12:04.716
And when we're back in Ireland, and I was the

276
00:12:04.716 --> 00:12:06.996
only sober one, but that was another side story.

277
00:12:06.996 --> 00:12:09.316
But we started PyCon Ireland.

278
00:12:09.316 --> 00:12:11.076
And yes, a bunch of us.

279
00:12:11.076 --> 00:12:13.596
And of course, when you need someone to open

280
00:12:13.596 --> 00:12:16.260
the conference and being a bunch of techies, no

281
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.852
one wants to stand in front of everyone.

282
00:12:17.852 --> 00:12:19.580
So I got, hey, Vicky,

283
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.700
you're doing a bunch of work.

284
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:21.740
You know what's going on.

285
00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.324
You go and tell everyone what's happening.

286
00:12:23.324 --> 00:12:26.028
So people say it's down to practice. When, how. Why?

287
00:12:26.028 --> 00:12:27.604
How do you speak in front of people?

288
00:12:27.604 --> 00:12:29.908
But it's more like it's still quite nerve,

289
00:12:29.908 --> 00:12:33.068
nerve wracking, but you have to do it. It's like a job.

290
00:12:33.068 --> 00:12:34.348
You just get pushed out in front

291
00:12:34.348 --> 00:12:36.224
or else the conference will never start.

292
00:12:37.004 --> 00:12:38.852
So we just went ahead, did it.

293
00:12:38.852 --> 00:12:41.596
And so it wasn't just me, it was a team effort.

294
00:12:41.596 --> 00:12:43.092
It was such a big job.

295
00:12:43.092 --> 00:12:44.132
Okay, fair enough.

296
00:12:44.132 --> 00:12:46.500
Myself and my husband did spend the first

297
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.540
planning the first PyCon, mostly in Hong Kong and

298
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.004
Starbucks, trying to figure out sponsorship and figuring out

299
00:12:52.004 --> 00:12:54.060
swag and programs and the website.

300
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.788
We did most of stuff, but it's still a

301
00:12:55.788 --> 00:12:57.980
team effort because we need that support from the

302
00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.564
community in order to make it happen.

303
00:12:59.564 --> 00:13:00.524
And we had to start

304
00:13:00.524 --> 00:13:02.132
from scratch, everything from scratch.

305
00:13:02.132 --> 00:13:03.004
And it's really hard.

306
00:13:03.004 --> 00:13:06.004
So I completely, you know, understand if someone

307
00:13:06.004 --> 00:13:08.848
was starting anything from scratch with nothing to

308
00:13:08.848 --> 00:13:11.064
back, nothing, no sponsor, no nothing. We know.

309
00:13:11.064 --> 00:13:12.024
I know how hard it is.

310
00:13:12.024 --> 00:13:14.008
I just keep thinking back when I

311
00:13:14.008 --> 00:13:15.432
first started, how hard it was.

312
00:13:15.432 --> 00:13:17.368
And now, even with all the information, all

313
00:13:17.368 --> 00:13:19.120
the stuff that's happening, it's still hard.

314
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.704
You don't know where to go and where to start.

315
00:13:20.704 --> 00:13:21.920
So having, you know.

316
00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.976
So, yeah, I tried to give the information

317
00:13:23.976 --> 00:13:25.672
I have could be out of date, but

318
00:13:25.672 --> 00:13:27.216
I tried to learn from others as well.

319
00:13:27.216 --> 00:13:28.808
So it's always a learning process.

320
00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:29.912
You know how many people

321
00:13:29.912 --> 00:13:33.032
attended PyCon Ireland, last time?

322
00:13:33.032 --> 00:13:34.654
Do you know, like around.

323
00:13:34.654 --> 00:13:40.302
Well, I can tell you, whatever the max, the hotel can

324
00:13:40.302 --> 00:13:43.542
safely fit us in because we keep pushing the numbers.

325
00:13:43.542 --> 00:13:44.718
We went from 100.

326
00:13:44.718 --> 00:13:46.622
They saved us the first year because we lost

327
00:13:46.622 --> 00:13:48.646
our evening event space on the first year.

328
00:13:48.646 --> 00:13:49.982
Things go wrong as usual.

329
00:13:49.982 --> 00:13:51.774
It always goes wrong when you organize stuff.

330
00:13:51.774 --> 00:13:54.646
So this hotel, Horizon Blue, they hosted us.

331
00:13:54.646 --> 00:13:55.830
It was like, initially it was like

332
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.814
100, 150 to 250 to 350.

333
00:13:58.814 --> 00:14:00.238
We keep pushing and pushing.

334
00:14:00.238 --> 00:14:01.552
So whatever the max.

335
00:14:01.552 --> 00:14:03.784
I don't know, 400? I have no idea.

336
00:14:03.784 --> 00:14:05.656
Whatever the max, their halls fit.

337
00:14:05.656 --> 00:14:07.272
It's like three banquet halls that they.

338
00:14:07.272 --> 00:14:09.024
It's like a huge banquet hall that can split into

339
00:14:09.024 --> 00:14:11.832
three for a session is very normal in hotels.

340
00:14:11.832 --> 00:14:13.520
And then for the plenary, they opened up the

341
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.728
three halls again to make it a plenary session.

342
00:14:15.728 --> 00:14:18.720
So whatever the safety, the safe amount of

343
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.232
people they can fit in for their health

344
00:14:20.232 --> 00:14:22.320
and safety, that is the amount. It's a few hundred.

345
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.968
So it's quite good and quite consistent, like, as well.

346
00:14:26.968 --> 00:14:28.400
So it's nice to see and it's nice

347
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.604
to be an attendee and not an organizer.

348
00:14:33.234 --> 00:14:36.722
So currently, what are you actually working on?

349
00:14:36.722 --> 00:14:39.010
Like, is there any new activities or

350
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:42.754
some Python related events or PyLadies?

351
00:14:42.754 --> 00:14:45.402
Yeah, I still run PyLadies each month.

352
00:14:45.402 --> 00:14:47.618
There is a growing team of helpers.

353
00:14:47.618 --> 00:14:50.082
I'm trying to support them and trying to get them

354
00:14:50.082 --> 00:14:54.218
to get things going, like the Python study group and

355
00:14:54.218 --> 00:14:56.506
things like that, and any ideas like PyLadies.

356
00:14:56.506 --> 00:14:59.874
Dublin we're very open on what people want to do.

357
00:14:59.874 --> 00:15:02.930
I can be very experimental. Other things.

358
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.226
I'm involved with another

359
00:15:04.226 --> 00:15:05.894
initiative called Coding Grace.

360
00:15:06.674 --> 00:15:09.210
We advocate diversity in tech, mainly myself

361
00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:13.334
through coding Grace, we curate newsletters and

362
00:15:13.954 --> 00:15:15.810
events in around the island of Ireland.

363
00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:19.106
But we do have a virtual series of events

364
00:15:19.106 --> 00:15:21.738
for the next few months coming up called Cupán Tae

365
00:15:21.738 --> 00:15:24.658
Cupán Tae is an irish word for cup of tea,

366
00:15:24.658 --> 00:15:27.746
because, as I mentioned, we don't like, PyLadies,

367
00:15:27.746 --> 00:15:30.842
We don't like beer and pizza, so we like a cup tea.

368
00:15:30.842 --> 00:15:31.582
I do have a couple.

369
00:15:31.582 --> 00:15:34.024
My mug of tea in front of me right now, an Irish Tea.

370
00:15:35.004 --> 00:15:36.544
And that's this particular.

371
00:15:37.204 --> 00:15:39.948
This particular conference is aimed at principal engineers, head

372
00:15:39.948 --> 00:15:42.228
of engineering staff engineers, because we do, there's a

373
00:15:42.228 --> 00:15:44.156
lot of events, but there's not one.

374
00:15:44.156 --> 00:15:46.860
There wasn't one aimed at very senior level, so

375
00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.940
we wanted to create one called Cupán Tae Conf.

376
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.196
So hopefully we get enough

377
00:15:51.196 --> 00:15:53.468
interest for the virtual ones.

378
00:15:53.468 --> 00:15:56.044
We do have three speakers all lined up.

379
00:15:56.044 --> 00:15:58.636
Laura Nolan talking about path dependence.

380
00:15:58.636 --> 00:16:01.404
History matters on March 26, John Looney second

381
00:16:01.404 --> 00:16:03.164
system event, not a new problem, on April

382
00:16:03.164 --> 00:16:06.052
4, Patricia Aas, who's an international speaker talking

383
00:16:06.052 --> 00:16:08.444
about classic vulnerabilities in May 7th

384
00:16:08.444 --> 00:16:12.188
And details can be found in cupantaeconf.com

385
00:16:12.188 --> 00:16:13.944
That's one big one.

386
00:16:14.524 --> 00:16:15.916
How do you spell cupantea?

387
00:16:15.916 --> 00:16:17.524
Can I have a cup on tea, please?

388
00:16:17.524 --> 00:16:18.076
Cupán

389
00:16:18.076 --> 00:16:19.564
So C U P.

390
00:16:19.564 --> 00:16:20.700
So there's an á.

391
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.844
I know in French, you call it an "aigu".

392
00:16:22.844 --> 00:16:24.916
So I don't know what other languages, what you call it

393
00:16:24.916 --> 00:16:25.664
It's like.

394
00:16:26.204 --> 00:16:29.344
It's like on top of the a there is like a

395
00:16:30.524 --> 00:16:32.060
Accent aigu. Yeah.

396
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:36.180
So in Irish, that's a "Fada", because elongates the a.

397
00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.036
So it's Cupán.

398
00:16:37.036 --> 00:16:40.884
So C U P A Fada N. Cupán. Space. T A E.

399
00:16:40.884 --> 00:16:42.644
And that's tae. Cupán Tae.

400
00:16:42.644 --> 00:16:45.464
So it's a cup of tea. Right. Right.

401
00:16:46.124 --> 00:16:48.180
So what is irish tea?

402
00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.468
Is it black tea or?

403
00:16:49.468 --> 00:16:51.740
Yeah, it's normal tea. We have.

404
00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.636
I don't want to go into the whole argument. There's two.

405
00:16:54.636 --> 00:16:56.780
There's Lyons, or Barry's. Lyons is pretty

406
00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.508
much in Dublin, but everywhere else is Barry's,

407
00:16:58.508 --> 00:16:59.740
and I'm Barry's tea person.

408
00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.428
But I don't know if you want to keep that in

409
00:17:01.428 --> 00:17:04.144
the podcast, but it might cause a fury in Ireland.

410
00:17:05.564 --> 00:17:07.212
"I don't want to listen to Vicky anymore!"

411
00:17:07.212 --> 00:17:08.743
"She drinks Barry's tea!"

412
00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:12.460
Tea should be that way.

413
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.604
Yes, it should be like Barry's or Lyons.

414
00:17:14.604 --> 00:17:16.372
You know, the Lyons when people know it's

415
00:17:16.372 --> 00:17:18.332
Lyons because it's like a pyramid shaped tea

416
00:17:18.332 --> 00:17:20.324
bag and it's all these kind of things.

417
00:17:20.324 --> 00:17:21.900
If you go down further south

418
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.084
of Ireland, it's definitely Barry's tea.

419
00:17:24.084 --> 00:17:25.740
I grew up with Barry's tea.

420
00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.652
I think it's fine, but it's fun to pull the leg

421
00:17:28.652 --> 00:17:31.036
of people who are very serious about their irish tea.

422
00:17:31.036 --> 00:17:33.228
You drink your tea with milk or.

423
00:17:33.228 --> 00:17:34.778
Yeah, I drink my tea with milk.

424
00:17:34.778 --> 00:17:37.674
No sugar sometimes, but normally no sugar.

425
00:17:37.674 --> 00:17:39.738
Yeah, this is a funny conversation.

426
00:17:39.738 --> 00:17:40.578
Normally a conversation.

427
00:17:40.578 --> 00:17:41.970
I will actually talk if I was running

428
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.294
a podcast or Cupán Tae, to be honest.

429
00:17:45.234 --> 00:17:48.586
But yeah, I do have a cup of milk tea in

430
00:17:48.586 --> 00:17:51.946
front of me and it's a mug with cats on it.

431
00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:53.214
Don't know if you see it.

432
00:17:55.354 --> 00:17:56.654
For the podcast.

433
00:17:58.834 --> 00:18:00.494
Just so happen I picked it up.

434
00:18:01.714 --> 00:18:03.778
You have quite a professional setup.

435
00:18:03.778 --> 00:18:06.010
Do you do other things with or why

436
00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.514
do you have such a professional setup?

437
00:18:07.514 --> 00:18:10.882
Oh, that was from thanks to COVID, things got

438
00:18:10.882 --> 00:18:14.370
upgraded more and more because my imac only had,

439
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.458
I think the camera was like 720p

440
00:18:16.458 --> 00:18:18.058
and I wasn't very happy with it.

441
00:18:18.058 --> 00:18:19.498
I wanted more high def because I was

442
00:18:19.498 --> 00:18:22.290
doing a lot of podcasts, streaming, live streaming

443
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:23.554
and stuff and I wasn't very happy.

444
00:18:23.554 --> 00:18:24.962
And I want a higher camera ratio

445
00:18:24.962 --> 00:18:26.354
I want at least 1080.

446
00:18:26.354 --> 00:18:27.354
I want at least 1080.

447
00:18:27.354 --> 00:18:29.666
So my camera, it got upgraded.

448
00:18:29.666 --> 00:18:31.146
My lights got upgraded.

449
00:18:31.146 --> 00:18:33.570
My microphone upgraded at least twice.

450
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.602
I think I have like audio switchers.

451
00:18:35.602 --> 00:18:38.130
I have, you know, other switches in front of

452
00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.530
me and then the lights in the back keeps

453
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:42.306
getting upgraded a little bit here and there.

454
00:18:42.306 --> 00:18:43.210
So yeah, there's a lot of.

455
00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.074
I still got lots of things kind of I want to

456
00:18:45.074 --> 00:18:47.986
do because it's not just purely I want to do a

457
00:18:47.986 --> 00:18:50.418
lot more content creation, but been talking about that for two

458
00:18:50.418 --> 00:18:52.466
years to everyone who's known me so far.

459
00:18:52.466 --> 00:18:54.922
But before that I've been doing a lot of stuff for.

460
00:18:54.922 --> 00:18:56.794
When I was a maker advocate for Dublin Maker.

461
00:18:56.794 --> 00:18:58.722
That was in my past, it was part of.

462
00:18:58.722 --> 00:19:01.722
It was actually a cool freelance gig with Dublin Maker.

463
00:19:01.722 --> 00:19:04.130
If you're into the making culture, they

464
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.650
run a Maker festival and COVID really

465
00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.170
dented the whole maker advocacy because you're

466
00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:11.354
meeting makers, physically meeting makers.

467
00:19:11.354 --> 00:19:13.530
You physically go into colleges, talking to

468
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.882
lecturers that you're potentially helping teachers learn

469
00:19:15.882 --> 00:19:17.794
about STEAM and workshops and stuff.

470
00:19:17.794 --> 00:19:20.730
And you can't do that when there's a whole lockdown.

471
00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:22.850
And at one stage, we can't even go outside,

472
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:25.058
two clicks outside our home from our own.

473
00:19:25.058 --> 00:19:27.170
So what we end up doing was, what

474
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:28.778
I ended up doing was doing more content

475
00:19:28.778 --> 00:19:31.410
creation, doing my own stuff, learning to sew,

476
00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.946
showing that off, and then starting to interview

477
00:19:33.946 --> 00:19:37.314
other, remotely other makers in and around Ireland.

478
00:19:37.314 --> 00:19:39.698
Then we had to do a virtual Dublin Maker festival.

479
00:19:39.698 --> 00:19:42.538
That was fun, where we had, like,

480
00:19:42.538 --> 00:19:44.818
a newscaster type thing with two side

481
00:19:44.818 --> 00:19:47.858
science communicators running around like a roving

482
00:19:47.858 --> 00:19:50.226
reporters, doing live interviews and stuff.

483
00:19:50.226 --> 00:19:53.082
And I was also broadcasting as well as

484
00:19:53.082 --> 00:19:54.778
in the behind the scenes operations as well.

485
00:19:54.778 --> 00:19:56.674
So it was completely hectic.

486
00:19:56.674 --> 00:19:59.546
And then after that, I went in with another friend.

487
00:19:59.546 --> 00:20:01.010
We did an Irish Makers podcast.

488
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.570
We interviewed a lot of different people, from

489
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:07.834
blacksmiths to special effects people, to bladesmiths to

490
00:20:07.834 --> 00:20:10.970
cosplayers to people, how they felt makers, how

491
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:14.170
they felt being isolated during COVID Well, all

492
00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.362
those kind of different topics. So it was.

493
00:20:16.362 --> 00:20:18.930
And we even went to Dublin ComicCon

494
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:20.818
and interviewed a lot of cosplayers there.

495
00:20:20.818 --> 00:20:23.194
So we did a lot of content work,

496
00:20:23.194 --> 00:20:25.266
and also Dublin maker itself on site.

497
00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:28.690
So besides sitting here, we were also doing stuff

498
00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:32.618
off site or on site at the various locations.

499
00:20:32.618 --> 00:20:34.674
So that's why all the setup is just gone

500
00:20:34.674 --> 00:20:37.930
It's just got built up over the period, thanks to COVID, as

501
00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.770
I said, and ended up doing a lot of digital stuff. So.

502
00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:43.458
And that kind of feeds into some of the.

503
00:20:43.458 --> 00:20:45.890
I think mostly, yeah, that was the Maker stuff,

504
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.722
which I still tried to promote, I think, during

505
00:20:47.722 --> 00:20:50.138
COVID helped a lot during PyLadies Dublin as well.

506
00:20:50.138 --> 00:20:52.082
We kept on going with our monthly meetups,

507
00:20:52.082 --> 00:20:54.098
so we saw that there was a lot

508
00:20:54.098 --> 00:20:57.674
of people watching playbacks, not necessarily attending live,

509
00:20:57.674 --> 00:21:00.122
because I think people were having Zoom fatigue

510
00:21:00.122 --> 00:21:01.946
at that stage, which is very understandable.

511
00:21:01.946 --> 00:21:03.522
I made peace with the numbers.

512
00:21:03.522 --> 00:21:06.282
I was very upset setting it all up and

513
00:21:06.282 --> 00:21:09.498
had a few new meltdowns because tech went wrong.

514
00:21:09.498 --> 00:21:11.274
One stage, people didn't leave after

515
00:21:11.274 --> 00:21:13.410
20 minutes of tech melting down.

516
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.658
They were still hanging around for me to keep it going.

517
00:21:15.658 --> 00:21:17.514
And I had a very special guest as well.

518
00:21:17.514 --> 00:21:20.042
I think it was from ImagiLabs.

519
00:21:20.042 --> 00:21:23.122
I had the CTO one that was like my January

520
00:21:23.122 --> 00:21:25.874
very big event, and it went horribly, horribly wrong.

521
00:21:25.874 --> 00:21:27.106
But everyone was super nice.

522
00:21:27.106 --> 00:21:28.578
And that's what I love about

523
00:21:28.578 --> 00:21:31.194
communities like ours, especially PyLadies Dublin.

524
00:21:31.194 --> 00:21:34.690
Technical difficulties, either virtual or even just this month when

525
00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.098
we had our meetup, we had a few technical difficulties,

526
00:21:37.098 --> 00:21:39.218
and people are all okay with it because they're just

527
00:21:39.218 --> 00:21:42.314
super nice, you know, but that's tech.

528
00:21:42.314 --> 00:21:45.234
And I'm hoping to, myself and my husband

529
00:21:45.234 --> 00:21:48.458
hoping to improve our recording at different, at

530
00:21:48.458 --> 00:21:50.482
the PyLadies events at the very least.

531
00:21:50.482 --> 00:21:52.834
And hopefully we will help other user groups

532
00:21:52.834 --> 00:21:56.450
who are running their technical meetups to help

533
00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.690
them record their talks, because I can see

534
00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:00.530
people asking them, are your talks recorded?

535
00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:01.738
Are your talks recorded?

536
00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:02.774
And they're not.

537
00:22:03.594 --> 00:22:05.170
So we're not going to do it for free, but we're

538
00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.498
not also not going to charge them a huge amount.

539
00:22:07.498 --> 00:22:11.858
But we definitely understand that, you know, people do need some

540
00:22:11.858 --> 00:22:13.810
of the content and we just give them the videos, you

541
00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:16.082
know, take the videos, clean it up a bit and just

542
00:22:16.082 --> 00:22:19.538
give it to them and let them, let them like, so

543
00:22:19.538 --> 00:22:23.362
it's just to, again, an extension of, you know, community work

544
00:22:23.362 --> 00:22:25.458
that we're doing here and helping people.

545
00:22:25.458 --> 00:22:27.634
And especially now that I heard feedback that

546
00:22:27.634 --> 00:22:30.810
people do appreciate online events because it's more

547
00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:33.714
accessible, because they can't come into the city

548
00:22:33.714 --> 00:22:35.514
to go to an event in the evening.

549
00:22:35.514 --> 00:22:37.410
Things are just in, the real life is

550
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:38.730
in the way you can't make it.

551
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.994
It's not like they don't want to come.

552
00:22:40.994 --> 00:22:44.274
They physically can't make the time to get to it, but

553
00:22:44.274 --> 00:22:47.450
they would be able to watch it if it's online or

554
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:52.994
make playback, but they do appreciate if it's streamed online.

555
00:22:52.994 --> 00:22:55.738
So I kind of appreciated that kind of feedback as well.

556
00:22:55.738 --> 00:22:58.186
So, so we're making a conscious effort to try and make

557
00:22:58.186 --> 00:23:00.770
it accessible, but it is a lot more work, as you

558
00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.362
know, here with a lot of editing and video.

559
00:23:03.362 --> 00:23:06.210
It does take a lot more time and stuff like that.

560
00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.210
And so people, if you, if you.

561
00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:12.294
Need help, Vicky and her husband is here for you.

562
00:23:13.754 --> 00:23:16.250
I think there's one more that was very interesting thing

563
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:19.610
that I'm involved in, is I try to stay away

564
00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:22.130
from startups, but I'm bumped into a friend of mine,

565
00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:24.690
as everyone does after COVID for a coffee.

566
00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.258
And I told her, there's this itch that I'm scratching

567
00:23:27.258 --> 00:23:30.282
from Coding Grace side, that there was a lot of female

568
00:23:30.282 --> 00:23:34.642
founders are coming to us for advice, just privately asking

569
00:23:34.642 --> 00:23:36.698
for help, saying that they're not techies.

570
00:23:36.698 --> 00:23:37.818
What do I do?

571
00:23:37.818 --> 00:23:39.042
What tech do I use?

572
00:23:39.042 --> 00:23:41.658
Oh, I'm locked out of my AWS account.

573
00:23:41.658 --> 00:23:45.322
The person that was contracting us can't be found because

574
00:23:45.322 --> 00:23:47.466
they forgot to give us all this kind of stuff.

575
00:23:47.466 --> 00:23:50.234
And, you know, how do we do we get a CTO net?

576
00:23:50.234 --> 00:23:51.234
All these kind of questions.

577
00:23:51.234 --> 00:23:52.602
I was just telling my friend, and

578
00:23:52.602 --> 00:23:54.522
she just so happens to be relaunching.

579
00:23:54.522 --> 00:23:55.578
TechFoundHer.

580
00:23:55.578 --> 00:23:58.848
So Tech Found and then H E R, and she wanted to do a

581
00:23:58.848 --> 00:24:02.328
bootcamp and she said she had similar ideas, similar people coming up

582
00:24:02.328 --> 00:24:04.792
to her as well, but she was more in the startup space,

583
00:24:04.792 --> 00:24:06.368
so she was talking to a lot of people.

584
00:24:06.368 --> 00:24:09.752
So between my background and her background as well,

585
00:24:09.752 --> 00:24:11.192
she used to run Tech For Good Dublin

586
00:24:11.192 --> 00:24:12.880
We decided to put our heads together last year to

587
00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.352
run this bootcamp and we're doing again this year.

588
00:24:15.352 --> 00:24:19.024
It's aimed at female founders in the kind of pre-seed like

589
00:24:19.024 --> 00:24:20.856
early stage or you have an idea and you want to

590
00:24:20.856 --> 00:24:23.856
create a startup but you don't necessarily have a tech background,

591
00:24:23.856 --> 00:24:26.880
but you know you will end up using some tech in

592
00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:29.360
some form or another in your startup.

593
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.016
It's a way to bring the community together, share

594
00:24:31.016 --> 00:24:34.600
experiences, kind of demystify tech, and just to know

595
00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.288
you don't have to be a coder to run

596
00:24:36.288 --> 00:24:38.568
us through a startup that uses tech as well.

597
00:24:38.568 --> 00:24:42.184
And we have some pretty amazing kind of speakers

598
00:24:42.184 --> 00:24:43.992
which will be announced in the next few weeks.

599
00:24:43.992 --> 00:24:46.848
And the bootcamp itself is happening on Tuesday, April

600
00:24:46.848 --> 00:24:52.024
16 in a historical beautiful building that is at

601
00:24:52.024 --> 00:24:54.360
Dublin City hall in Dublin city centre.

602
00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.560
And looking forward to that.

603
00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.144
So that's kind of something a little bit different,

604
00:24:59.144 --> 00:25:02.304
sort of related crosses over, because again, it advocates

605
00:25:02.304 --> 00:25:05.928
diversity in an area startup, which is, I know

606
00:25:05.928 --> 00:25:07.872
we have a lot of problems in tech. Oh my goodness.

607
00:25:07.872 --> 00:25:11.604
Startup is like another barrel of fun there.

608
00:25:12.304 --> 00:25:14.328
So it's good to be able to

609
00:25:14.328 --> 00:25:17.096
help where I can with TechFoundHer.

610
00:25:17.096 --> 00:25:18.976
So I'm pretty much kind of helping the

611
00:25:18.976 --> 00:25:21.496
operation side of things where I can.

612
00:25:21.496 --> 00:25:23.320
So as you can see, when I do a lot of these

613
00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.992
kind of events, I tend to be ended up admin and operations.

614
00:25:26.992 --> 00:25:30.688
So that's why it's not the most fun part of it, but

615
00:25:30.688 --> 00:25:34.088
it is necessary for anyone who wants to get in community.

616
00:25:34.088 --> 00:25:35.856
Yes, it's lovely to talk to people.

617
00:25:35.856 --> 00:25:39.008
It's scary to talk in front of a lot of people

618
00:25:39.008 --> 00:25:42.056
if you're on stage, if you're not comfortable, but you still

619
00:25:42.056 --> 00:25:44.384
have to do a lot of admin work in the background,

620
00:25:44.384 --> 00:25:46.424
which is not the fun part, but you have to like

621
00:25:46.424 --> 00:25:52.240
finances, your AGMs, if you're a incorporated kind of organization and

622
00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.584
all that kind of stuff, it is.

623
00:25:53.584 --> 00:25:55.424
It is not fun, but you have to do it.

624
00:25:55.424 --> 00:25:57.960
But I somehow I keep on, I don't

625
00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.848
know, would you say punishing myself for this?

626
00:25:59.848 --> 00:26:00.632
I keep doing.

627
00:26:00.632 --> 00:26:02.736
I don't think that's kind of like punishing.

628
00:26:02.736 --> 00:26:04.892
It's just like if you want something to

629
00:26:04.892 --> 00:26:06.700
move on, someone has to do the job.

630
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.744
Right, yeah.

631
00:26:08.604 --> 00:26:10.172
And I think it's really hard to.

632
00:26:10.172 --> 00:26:13.172
Find someone to like last minute.

633
00:26:13.172 --> 00:26:14.668
If you want to find someone to manage, to

634
00:26:14.668 --> 00:26:18.100
finance, probably it's much faster to get yourself to.

635
00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.524
It's great.

636
00:26:19.524 --> 00:26:21.052
It's great experience, especially.

637
00:26:21.052 --> 00:26:24.036
I noticed that, like doing small kind of

638
00:26:24.036 --> 00:26:26.428
events, small organizations like the ones I do,

639
00:26:26.428 --> 00:26:28.380
I can turn around stuff very quickly.

640
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:32.420
But then, as I said, I worked as the maker advocate

641
00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.484
for Dublin Maker, and that was actually a paid position.

642
00:26:34.484 --> 00:26:36.884
It was a very special once one, and it was

643
00:26:36.884 --> 00:26:40.972
part of, it was funded by Science Foundation Ireland.

644
00:26:40.972 --> 00:26:41.980
So the money has to go through

645
00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.196
an institution which is a university.

646
00:26:44.196 --> 00:26:46.756
So Dublin City University was where one of

647
00:26:46.756 --> 00:26:49.748
the volunteer organizers or the founders worked, and

648
00:26:49.748 --> 00:26:51.868
that's where the money was going through and

649
00:26:51.868 --> 00:26:53.604
that's where the funding was going to.

650
00:26:53.604 --> 00:26:55.844
And so I was kind of a staff of

651
00:26:55.844 --> 00:26:57.868
the university, so it was a public institution.

652
00:26:57.868 --> 00:27:01.436
Dealing with finance was a completely new scale

653
00:27:01.436 --> 00:27:05.644
from mini organization that I look after to

654
00:27:05.644 --> 00:27:09.092
a university which has two different finance departments.

655
00:27:09.092 --> 00:27:11.116
You try not to annoy any of them, trying to

656
00:27:11.116 --> 00:27:14.372
be friends as you sort out through your budgets and

657
00:27:14.372 --> 00:27:17.052
stuff, because you have to write reports for the funder

658
00:27:17.052 --> 00:27:19.172
who funds you, and you have to make sure everything

659
00:27:19.172 --> 00:27:23.740
and their system is so slow and everything and codes

660
00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.596
everywhere and all these words you never heard of before.

661
00:27:26.596 --> 00:27:29.284
And I was very lucky.

662
00:27:29.284 --> 00:27:31.464
The staff there is very nice.

663
00:27:32.124 --> 00:27:35.190
The department secretary was so patient, and I was

664
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:37.622
there nearly every day for like the first three

665
00:27:37.622 --> 00:27:40.654
weeks, trying to ask so many questions.

666
00:27:40.654 --> 00:27:42.654
So it's a great experience.

667
00:27:42.654 --> 00:27:44.750
I know it's not what everyone thinks of when

668
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.238
they say they want to start up like a

669
00:27:47.238 --> 00:27:49.414
community group or running a conference and things like

670
00:27:49.414 --> 00:27:53.430
that, but it's great experience, especially when it comes

671
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:57.398
to organization in general operations.

672
00:27:57.398 --> 00:27:59.590
And as you say, finances helps a lot.

673
00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:01.222
At least you have an inkling of what a

674
00:28:01.222 --> 00:28:04.774
budget is, how expenses work, everything, you know, keep

675
00:28:04.774 --> 00:28:07.910
things on track, the, you know, things like that.

676
00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:09.470
They're trying to figure out how to,

677
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:11.950
how to herd cats, as with all

678
00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:14.206
volunteers, trying to run conferences and stuff.

679
00:28:14.206 --> 00:28:18.014
So it's good experience and it will help you

680
00:28:18.014 --> 00:28:20.598
if you in your career as well, in, you

681
00:28:20.598 --> 00:28:22.270
know, in your day to day stuff as well.

682
00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:24.006
So it's not purely just for.

683
00:28:24.006 --> 00:28:25.526
Just for people bearing in mind if

684
00:28:25.526 --> 00:28:26.846
they want to come, come help.

685
00:28:26.846 --> 00:28:28.070
I'm not trying to scare you away, but

686
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:31.942
it is very good skills, really good life

687
00:28:31.942 --> 00:28:34.230
skills, and very good skills in general to

688
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:38.480
have, because you won't be, because it's just.

689
00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.208
It's not something that you can just pick.

690
00:28:40.208 --> 00:28:41.952
Yeah, it's not something that you just pick

691
00:28:41.952 --> 00:28:43.480
up just like that and just do it. Yeah.

692
00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.264
Because you have to work with a lot of people as well.

693
00:28:46.264 --> 00:28:47.120
And of course, when it

694
00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.088
When it comes, when you have to

695
00:28:48.088 --> 00:28:50.096
handle finances, it's quite important that you

696
00:28:50.096 --> 00:28:53.224
do it right in transparency as well.

697
00:28:53.224 --> 00:28:56.912
Somehow I feel like starting all those community events

698
00:28:56.912 --> 00:28:59.416
is a little bit like you being the founder

699
00:28:59.416 --> 00:29:02.732
of a company, you know, because you have

700
00:29:02.732 --> 00:29:06.104
to start everything and handle everything at the beginning.

701
00:29:06.924 --> 00:29:15.164
Branding, PR, marketing, social media, like you said

702
00:29:15.164 --> 00:29:19.516
before, like sponsorship and getting where the money

703
00:29:19.516 --> 00:29:21.652
comes in, where the money goes out and

704
00:29:21.652 --> 00:29:23.540
whether you can continue next year.

705
00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:26.588
And it's a little bit like starting a company.

706
00:29:26.588 --> 00:29:27.340
Yeah.

707
00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.580
And finding venues, finding venues is

708
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:31.316
hard here in Dublin right now.

709
00:29:31.316 --> 00:29:34.108
I think it's as, again, COVID keeps popping up

710
00:29:34.108 --> 00:29:36.492
in my thing every time because it has dented

711
00:29:36.492 --> 00:29:39.332
a lot of different things between community groups to

712
00:29:39.332 --> 00:29:43.476
availability of different venues to nowadays because of, I

713
00:29:43.476 --> 00:29:47.068
suppose, the world, global things happening, produce goes up

714
00:29:47.068 --> 00:29:49.372
in price as well, all these kind of things.

715
00:29:49.372 --> 00:29:53.188
So for me, I want to tell people, when you run a

716
00:29:53.188 --> 00:29:56.324
meetup, you don't have to have food if you don't need to.

717
00:29:56.324 --> 00:29:58.932
I think. Because I.

718
00:29:58.932 --> 00:30:01.452
I have done PyLadies Dublin, where

719
00:30:01.452 --> 00:30:03.172
I ask people to bring their own

720
00:30:03.172 --> 00:30:05.716
beverages and their own kind of sandwiches.

721
00:30:05.716 --> 00:30:07.100
I think someone mentioned brown

722
00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.164
bag, right?

723
00:30:09.164 --> 00:30:11.652
And also I wanted to mention that I heard

724
00:30:11.652 --> 00:30:15.068
you also drink coffee, which is besides tea.

725
00:30:15.068 --> 00:30:15.744
Yes.

726
00:30:17.804 --> 00:30:19.060
So I think that's.

727
00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.372
So you are not going to upset anybody in this podcast.

728
00:30:21.372 --> 00:30:22.784
No, no, no, no.

729
00:30:23.404 --> 00:30:24.932
I do drink a bit of coffee, but

730
00:30:24.932 --> 00:30:29.004
not too much, I think, for anyone, organizing

731
00:30:29.004 --> 00:30:31.176
kind of small meetup groups would be great.

732
00:30:31.176 --> 00:30:34.080
And I think lucky if you can get a company to

733
00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.448
host you because normally they have a kitchenette, so people can

734
00:30:36.448 --> 00:30:38.384
make their own tea, coffee and grab some water.

735
00:30:38.384 --> 00:30:40.400
And depending on the type of companies, they'll

736
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.096
have snacks and stuff like that anyway.

737
00:30:42.096 --> 00:30:43.800
So people snack on stuff, but you don't

738
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.568
need your beer, you don't need your pizza,

739
00:30:45.568 --> 00:30:47.384
you don't need all those sandwiches.

740
00:30:47.384 --> 00:30:49.232
Smaller venues won't offer that.

741
00:30:49.232 --> 00:30:50.032
Yeah.

742
00:30:50.032 --> 00:30:52.080
And you'd be wasting food and things like that.

743
00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:52.944
You don't know where to go.

744
00:30:52.944 --> 00:30:55.048
I have in the early days where I have to

745
00:30:55.048 --> 00:30:58.042
bring platters of sandwiches back home and you're there looking

746
00:30:58.042 --> 00:31:00.402
at the fridge for three days with this sad sandwiches

747
00:31:00.402 --> 00:31:02.610
in the fridge and taking out all the salads so

748
00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:03.978
you can make your own salads from it.

749
00:31:03.978 --> 00:31:05.658
So you don't waste the salad. Oh, no.

750
00:31:05.658 --> 00:31:07.346
And then eventually you have to toss out some of

751
00:31:07.346 --> 00:31:10.466
the sandwiches anyway, because after three something days, then, you

752
00:31:10.466 --> 00:31:13.114
know, you don't want to get food poisoning.

753
00:31:13.114 --> 00:31:14.682
It's just you can't.

754
00:31:14.682 --> 00:31:16.442
And also, you can't just hand, you know,

755
00:31:16.442 --> 00:31:19.130
sandwiches to kind of homeless shelters because some

756
00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:20.162
of them would have been opened.

757
00:31:20.162 --> 00:31:21.898
There's a very strict guidelines on what

758
00:31:21.898 --> 00:31:24.386
they accept and don't accept, so. So.

759
00:31:24.386 --> 00:31:26.562
And this costs a lot of money catering.

760
00:31:26.562 --> 00:31:28.010
I'm just trying to tell people, but

761
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:29.802
we are so spoiled that people expect

762
00:31:29.802 --> 00:31:31.986
beer, pizza and sandwiches or whatever.

763
00:31:31.986 --> 00:31:33.802
There's food all the time.

764
00:31:33.802 --> 00:31:37.178
So, yeah, I run things very frugally

765
00:31:37.178 --> 00:31:39.854
for my own events, so I'm just

766
00:31:40.394 --> 00:31:43.386
mainly Coding Grace, PyLadies specifically.

767
00:31:43.386 --> 00:31:44.978
That's definitely zero budget.

768
00:31:44.978 --> 00:31:48.954
And then other things I do is Game Jams.

769
00:31:48.954 --> 00:31:50.826
Again, I run that very frugally.

770
00:31:50.826 --> 00:31:53.882
If I'm helping other people, I try to point out things,

771
00:31:53.882 --> 00:31:57.226
but it's their budget at the end of the day, so

772
00:31:57.226 --> 00:31:59.618
I can help them where I can and point out things.

773
00:31:59.618 --> 00:32:02.418
But for my own events that I run, I try

774
00:32:02.418 --> 00:32:06.082
to make sure that we don't waste any money.

775
00:32:06.082 --> 00:32:10.330
The money should be spent on the people, not on

776
00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:13.282
other frivolous stuff, I suppose, from my point of view.

777
00:32:13.282 --> 00:32:17.314
So, yeah, I have a question regarding what's next.

778
00:32:17.314 --> 00:32:20.074
Do you have small plans, big plans?

779
00:32:20.074 --> 00:32:21.454
Python plans?

780
00:32:22.874 --> 00:32:23.774
I suppose.

781
00:32:25.954 --> 00:32:29.522
When I mentioned Cupán Tae virtual talks, I did

782
00:32:29.522 --> 00:32:32.162
say that that's used to gauge the interest

783
00:32:32.162 --> 00:32:34.722
from people if they like the format.

784
00:32:34.722 --> 00:32:36.962
The format is person gives, the guest

785
00:32:36.962 --> 00:32:38.930
speaker gives the talk about an hour.

786
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.386
It's quite a long talk.

787
00:32:40.386 --> 00:32:42.202
It's very in depth technical talk,

788
00:32:42.202 --> 00:32:43.202
and they're followed by it on

789
00:32:43.202 --> 00:32:45.002
conference style breakout sessions afterwards.

790
00:32:45.002 --> 00:32:47.202
So it's like the DDD conference.

791
00:32:47.202 --> 00:32:48.442
You can do a search for that.

792
00:32:48.442 --> 00:32:50.002
It's sort of like that DDD

793
00:32:50.002 --> 00:32:51.458
on conference kind of format.

794
00:32:51.458 --> 00:32:52.762
But we were going to do it in

795
00:32:52.762 --> 00:32:55.634
person, but it didn't work out timing wise,

796
00:32:55.634 --> 00:32:57.834
so we decided to do virtual gauge interest.

797
00:32:57.834 --> 00:33:00.002
And we have enough interest. We would like to host

798
00:33:00.002 --> 00:33:01.752
this conference outside of Dublin.

799
00:33:01.752 --> 00:33:03.920
Because Dublin is expensive, we want to raise

800
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.392
the profile of the tech technical user group

801
00:33:06.392 --> 00:33:09.048
community in that local town or city.

802
00:33:09.048 --> 00:33:12.192
And also because people have been working remotely from

803
00:33:12.192 --> 00:33:14.656
home, some of those people might be, don't have

804
00:33:14.656 --> 00:33:16.408
to travel to Dublin, they can actually go to

805
00:33:16.408 --> 00:33:20.480
is conference because it is in their locale as well. So.

806
00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.000
And if this works out, we would like to

807
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.328
move to different towns and cities around Ireland to

808
00:33:24.328 --> 00:33:26.528
highlight the tech community and stuff like that.

809
00:33:26.528 --> 00:33:28.080
I hope you can see a passion here and what

810
00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:32.044
we're trying to do besides the Events on the Wheel.

811
00:33:33.864 --> 00:33:36.312
We're aiming at more senior people as

812
00:33:36.312 --> 00:33:38.440
well, because we want to be.

813
00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.616
We try to focus this one as well and also

814
00:33:40.616 --> 00:33:43.128
trying to make it sustainable because we're doing a lot

815
00:33:43.128 --> 00:33:45.984
of these events and said we've been very frugal, but

816
00:33:45.984 --> 00:33:48.456
doesn't mean that it's maintainable and sustainable.

817
00:33:48.456 --> 00:33:49.864
We don't actually, you know, charge

818
00:33:49.864 --> 00:33:52.040
memberships or anything like that. So that's one thing.

819
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.672
We're just trying to try this out.

820
00:33:53.672 --> 00:33:54.888
It's experimental.

821
00:33:54.888 --> 00:33:57.992
Myself, my husband is also on the team, founding

822
00:33:57.992 --> 00:34:00.232
team, and my friend who's based in London, who

823
00:34:00.232 --> 00:34:03.200
will be in New Zealand very soon.

824
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.960
So that's going to be fun to organize stuff together.

825
00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.592
That's a different challenge, remote organizing or someone

826
00:34:08.592 --> 00:34:09.808
on the other side of the world.

827
00:34:09.808 --> 00:34:11.800
But then that's one thing, and the other thing

828
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.208
is just keep recording talks at PyLadies Dublin and

829
00:34:14.208 --> 00:34:17.520
trying to perfect that process so myself and my

830
00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.880
husband can offer our help to other local tech

831
00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.992
community groups to record their talks.

832
00:34:21.992 --> 00:34:24.672
And hopefully I get to run another game jam,

833
00:34:24.672 --> 00:34:26.056
I suppose by the end of the year.

834
00:34:26.056 --> 00:34:27.904
We did one recently in Cork I would

835
00:34:27.904 --> 00:34:30.103
love to do in relation to that.

836
00:34:30.103 --> 00:34:31.824
That's part of Gamecraft. We did a.

837
00:34:31.824 --> 00:34:34.952
Last year we did a DIY custom game controller

838
00:34:34.952 --> 00:34:41.080
where we actually custom PCB board and we preloaded

839
00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.992
it with Python on it, MicroPython on it.

840
00:34:43.992 --> 00:34:46.255
And all the people had to do was

841
00:34:46.255 --> 00:34:49.760
learn how to connect the wires between the

842
00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.520
PCB board and the RaspberryPI Pico.

843
00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.032
And then they can just

844
00:34:54.032 --> 00:34:55.960
We just gave them lots of crafty stuff

845
00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.984
and they can just make their own board.

846
00:34:57.984 --> 00:35:00.368
Their game controllers or whatever they want

847
00:35:00.368 --> 00:35:02.204
to do with the controllers can be

848
00:35:02.784 --> 00:35:05.312
completely different, use whatever they want.

849
00:35:05.312 --> 00:35:07.816
But we gave them the components, so we did something.

850
00:35:07.816 --> 00:35:10.120
We did this for beta festival late last

851
00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.776
year and we have some components left over,

852
00:35:11.776 --> 00:35:14.324
so we want to run something again, similar.

853
00:35:15.184 --> 00:35:16.688
It was meant to be a jam, but it ended

854
00:35:16.688 --> 00:35:18.856
up becoming a workshop because we didn't want to scare

855
00:35:18.856 --> 00:35:21.888
people away because the electronics, they think that there's programming

856
00:35:21.888 --> 00:35:24.064
involved, but there's none because we preloaded it.

857
00:35:24.064 --> 00:35:25.496
You should just plug it in and should be able

858
00:35:25.496 --> 00:35:27.904
to play any game you want and things like that.

859
00:35:27.904 --> 00:35:31.448
So yeah, there's, as I said, I do a lot

860
00:35:31.448 --> 00:35:34.128
of different things, but the main core things is even

861
00:35:34.128 --> 00:35:38.200
get to a conference room, Cupán Tae kind of virtual talks

862
00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.096
and make that into an in person one.

863
00:35:40.096 --> 00:35:44.144
Because we want to actually have afternoon tea, because

864
00:35:44.144 --> 00:35:47.712
for lunch there's a whole theme going on there.

865
00:35:47.712 --> 00:35:49.576
We have a whole theme going on there.

866
00:35:49.576 --> 00:35:52.168
And it's going to be held in kind of

867
00:35:52.168 --> 00:35:54.096
down in the southeast and it's going to be

868
00:35:54.096 --> 00:35:57.552
in a grand house with lovely gardens and stuff.

869
00:35:57.552 --> 00:35:58.584
You know, that's the plan.

870
00:35:58.584 --> 00:36:00.080
We're going to see how things go.

871
00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.044
So those are the two kind of things.

872
00:36:02.604 --> 00:36:04.956
Two or three different things, but I'm sure there's lots

873
00:36:04.956 --> 00:36:08.316
of other stuff that I know, but they're, they're all

874
00:36:08.316 --> 00:36:10.524
kind of being juggled and ongoing at the same time.

875
00:36:10.524 --> 00:36:11.212
Right.

876
00:36:11.212 --> 00:36:14.544
Do you have any hidden hobbies that you.

877
00:36:21.244 --> 00:36:23.084
I heard so many things.

878
00:36:23.084 --> 00:36:25.668
You said something about sewing.

879
00:36:25.668 --> 00:36:27.676
Yeah, I have so many things I have

880
00:36:27.676 --> 00:36:29.924
to get back onto my sewing machine.

881
00:36:29.924 --> 00:36:31.428
I have so many patterns I want to make.

882
00:36:31.428 --> 00:36:36.348
My first pair of pants I've got, I've got cross

883
00:36:36.348 --> 00:36:39.652
stitching I want to get back on as well.

884
00:36:39.652 --> 00:36:41.644
What else have we got? Oh, I want to do.

885
00:36:41.644 --> 00:36:43.380
I want to finish off my kind of.

886
00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.900
What, what do I have back here?

887
00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:46.060
Hold on, I have something here.

888
00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:47.484
My lino print.

889
00:36:47.484 --> 00:36:49.508
Sorry, bit of a noise here, but I've

890
00:36:49.508 --> 00:36:51.764
been doing a bit of lino printing.

891
00:36:51.764 --> 00:36:53.884
Can I see, can you see this?

892
00:36:53.884 --> 00:36:57.020
Oh, wow, that's cool.

893
00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:58.692
So that's where a lino board,

894
00:36:58.692 --> 00:37:00.236
it's just right beside me.

895
00:37:00.236 --> 00:37:03.564
So that's me carving into Lino

896
00:37:03.564 --> 00:37:05.444
and trying not to cut myself.

897
00:37:05.444 --> 00:37:08.108
Also digital painting. What else?

898
00:37:08.108 --> 00:37:09.544
Oh, yeah, cross media.

899
00:37:10.124 --> 00:37:13.676
Cross media kind of art stuff that I want to do.

900
00:37:13.676 --> 00:37:16.180
Oh, I'm making zines. Oh, my God. I want to make zines.

901
00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:18.620
I want to make so many zines. What else do I have?

902
00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:20.724
I'm looking around me, I was like, so I'm sorry.

903
00:37:20.724 --> 00:37:22.652
In my room, this is also my Make room.

904
00:37:22.652 --> 00:37:24.900
So there's lots of things hanging around that

905
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.268
is on my to do list, which I

906
00:37:26.268 --> 00:37:28.770
have started and not come finished and completed.

907
00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:30.474
Of course, the other thing, big thing, is just

908
00:37:30.474 --> 00:37:34.218
renovating this room, making a proper maker room.

909
00:37:34.218 --> 00:37:36.986
But yeah, there's a lot of things that I want to do.

910
00:37:36.986 --> 00:37:40.098
It's just the time, really, and finishing it and

911
00:37:40.098 --> 00:37:43.066
I just, yeah, I just need to take, stand

912
00:37:43.066 --> 00:37:44.714
back and just want to do stuff.

913
00:37:44.714 --> 00:37:45.946
But then when I stand back and want to

914
00:37:45.946 --> 00:37:48.042
do stuff, I end up playing like games, like

915
00:37:48.042 --> 00:37:50.626
cozy games or something because that's just relaxing.

916
00:37:50.626 --> 00:37:53.574
And then I realize, oh, so,

917
00:37:55.514 --> 00:37:57.974
yeah, I get distracted so easily.

918
00:37:59.314 --> 00:38:02.146
So, yeah, if you ask me what I think, I just,

919
00:38:02.146 --> 00:38:04.842
too many to name, but I just need to sit down.

920
00:38:04.842 --> 00:38:07.090
I have also a lot of electronic projects that

921
00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:09.458
I want to do that have finished as well.

922
00:38:09.458 --> 00:38:12.298
And also so many different videos I want to make.

923
00:38:12.298 --> 00:38:15.762
Like my, you know, digital videos of my journeys

924
00:38:15.762 --> 00:38:18.882
over, you know, car journeys and things like that.

925
00:38:18.882 --> 00:38:21.042
Oh, it's just so much that I want to do.

926
00:38:21.042 --> 00:38:22.986
I just need to pick maybe the top

927
00:38:22.986 --> 00:38:24.734
three and just do it or something.

928
00:38:25.864 --> 00:38:28.600
Or when, you know, when the inspiration strikes.

929
00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.704
I'm currently knitting, so I'm knitting yoga

930
00:38:31.704 --> 00:38:33.960
socks with writing on them and.

931
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.432
But since December, I have a tufting gun, so my

932
00:38:37.432 --> 00:38:39.784
plan is to make some carpets in the flat, so.

933
00:38:39.784 --> 00:38:40.808
Oh, my goodness.

934
00:38:40.808 --> 00:38:42.644
You're on a completely different level.

935
00:38:45.704 --> 00:38:48.237
And she's really good in these, like.

936
00:38:48.237 --> 00:38:50.704
That stuff is hard!

937
00:38:50.704 --> 00:38:52.826
You should look at her knitting stuff.

938
00:38:52.826 --> 00:38:54.130
It's crazy.

939
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:56.954
She does like a, so I saw the recent one that she did.

940
00:38:56.954 --> 00:38:59.906
She did was like, sweater zigzag wave.

941
00:38:59.906 --> 00:39:01.018
But I followed the pattern.

942
00:39:01.018 --> 00:39:03.178
I mean, yeah, but still.

943
00:39:03.178 --> 00:39:06.346
So can we see your, your project

944
00:39:06.346 --> 00:39:08.290
on Instagram or where can we see.

945
00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:10.290
Your, like, I don't put up

946
00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:11.650
stuff that they're not really finished.

947
00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:13.562
I try to put up stuff with all that

948
00:39:13.562 --> 00:39:17.170
means there's not much, like, I can tell you.

949
00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:21.888
I did enjoy crocheting on, and at the time, many, many years

950
00:39:21.888 --> 00:39:27.264
ago, I asked my DnD GM if I can crochet

951
00:39:27.264 --> 00:39:30.848
a D 20, and he says, yes, as long as it's loaded right.

952
00:39:30.848 --> 00:39:33.072
And so I started crocheting.

953
00:39:33.072 --> 00:39:34.872
I'm quite new in the crocheting.

954
00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:37.880
Then I realized all the triangles were wrong, and I

955
00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.416
had, like, I would have them all sewing up, and

956
00:39:39.416 --> 00:39:41.552
I realized things were going wrong and didn't look right.

957
00:39:41.552 --> 00:39:43.704
I had to undo all the stitching. Had to undo.

958
00:39:43.704 --> 00:39:44.768
And then I started unraveling the

959
00:39:44.768 --> 00:39:47.800
stuff, and then I gave up. I was so sad. I gave up.

960
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.036
And I said, I'm don't do, I don't want to do it again.

961
00:39:50.036 --> 00:39:52.260
I don't want to crochet again

962
00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:55.340
You picked, like, a very complicated project.

963
00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.532
But I was very confident. I did too many.

964
00:39:57.532 --> 00:39:58.964
I did so many squares.

965
00:39:58.964 --> 00:40:00.364
I said, how hard could it be?

966
00:40:00.364 --> 00:40:01.464
Triangles.

967
00:40:02.724 --> 00:40:03.476
That's the same.

968
00:40:03.476 --> 00:40:06.468
When I wanted to do 3D printing.

969
00:40:06.468 --> 00:40:07.796
But the one with the pen.

970
00:40:07.796 --> 00:40:08.196
Yeah.

971
00:40:08.196 --> 00:40:10.236
You know, you can, like, you can get the pen.

972
00:40:10.236 --> 00:40:13.708
And my startup project was Pickle Rick.

973
00:40:13.708 --> 00:40:16.344
Oh, that's hard. Wow.

974
00:40:17.084 --> 00:40:19.324
Because there was a YouTube video about it,

975
00:40:19.324 --> 00:40:21.660
like, some guy, like, doing Pickle Rick.

976
00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.740
And I was following, you two can do it.

977
00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:24.964
I can do it.

978
00:40:24.964 --> 00:40:26.620
I think I spent, like, 4 hours.

979
00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:28.052
I made the head of Pickle Rick

980
00:40:28.052 --> 00:40:30.196
was kind of flat but looked cool.

981
00:40:30.196 --> 00:40:32.532
And then I gave it as a present to

982
00:40:32.532 --> 00:40:34.748
someone that was super excited about Pickle Rick.

983
00:40:34.748 --> 00:40:37.644
And then I never did 3D printing.

984
00:40:37.644 --> 00:40:40.384
Those 3D pens are hard to use though those 3D.

985
00:40:41.964 --> 00:40:45.484
So how do people get to get in touch with you

986
00:40:45.484 --> 00:40:49.514
if they want to, you know, maybe ask Vicky and to

987
00:40:49.514 --> 00:40:54.178
help with some recordings or get some advice from you?
